## Stamped

Stamped is a new way to recommend only what you like best â€”- restaurants, 
books, movies, music and more. No noise, no strangers, just the things you and 
your friends love.

The Stamped repository contains the implementation of the Stamped platform, as 
well as client code to access the platform from supported clients (e.g., 
currently only iOS).

Repository layout:

* clients - contains code and resources for all official Stamped frontend clients.
* deploy - contains scripts and utilities to automate the deployment of the stamped backend platform to the cloud.
* internal - contains internal projects and/or testing code.
* platform - contains the core implementation of all backend services that comprise the Stamped API.
