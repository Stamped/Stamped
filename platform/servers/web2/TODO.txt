    * replace previews in stamp-gallery-items with real elements
    
    * implement user stamp category distribution
        * TODO: figure out bargraph height issue
    
    * implement google maps stamp-gallery view
    
    * debug blurb and comment references via blurb_formatted
    
    * fix blockquotes (line-spacing is messed up on multiple lines...)
    
    * find feasible approach to color scheme constants
    
    * figure out why font-faces aren't loading on chrome
        * how to debug.. must be tools out there to help with this?
    
    * when stamp images don't load, they still display a border

POLISH:
    * link profile image to lightboxed full-resolution version

OPTIMIZE:
    * profile images we're downloading are 500x500 even for small previews -- wasteful!
