StatsD
======

A network daemon for aggregating statistics (counters and timers), rolling them up, then sending them to [graphite][graphite].

We ([Etsy][etsy]) [blogged][blog post] about how it works and why we created it.


Concepts
--------

* *buckets*
  Each stat is in it's own "bucket". They are not predefined anywhere. Buckets can be named anything that will translate to Graphite (periods make folders, etc)

* *values*
  Each stat will have a value. How it is interpreted depends on modifiers

* *flush*
  After the flush interval timeout (default 10 seconds), stats are munged and sent over to Graphite.

Counting
--------

    gorets:1|c

This is a simple counter. Add 1 to the "gorets" bucket. It stays in memory until the flush interval.


Timing
------

    glork:320|ms

The glork took 320ms to complete this time. StatsD figures out 90th percentile, average (mean), lower and upper bounds for the flush interval.

Sampling
--------

    gorets:1|c|@0.1

Tells StatsD that this counter is being sent sampled every 1/10th of the time.


Guts
----

* [UDP][udp]
  Client libraries use UDP to send information to the StatsD daemon.

* [NodeJS][node]
* [Graphite][graphite]

Graphite uses "schemas" to define the different round robin datasets it houses (analogous to RRAs in rrdtool). Here's what Etsy is using for the stats databases:

    [stats]
    priority = 110
    pattern = ^stats\..*
    retentions = 10:2160,60:10080,600:262974

That translates to:

* 6 hours of 10 second data (what we consider "near-realtime")
* 1 week of 1 minute data
* 5 years of 10 minute data

This has been a good tradeoff so far between size-of-file (round robin databases are fixed size) and data we care about. Each "stats" database is about 3.2 megs with these retentions.

Installation and Configuration
------------------------------

 * Install node.js
 * Clone the project
 * Create a config file from exampleConfig.js and put it somewhere
 * Start the Daemon:

    node stats.js /path/to/config


Inspiration
-----------

StatsD was inspired (heavily) by the project (of the same name) at Flickr. Here's a post where Cal Henderson described it in depth:
[Counting and timing](http://code.flickr.com/blog/2008/10/27/counting-timing/). Cal re-released the code recently: [Perl StatsD](https://github.com/iamcal/Flickr-StatsD)
