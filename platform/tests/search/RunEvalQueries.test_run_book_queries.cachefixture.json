The previously classified documents in this collection, converted for accurate flowing-text e-book format reproduction, were released by the NRO in September 2011 as part of its 50th anniversary. In declassifying these fascinating documents, the NRO has opened the curtain to show the tremendous challenges that were overcome to achieve the impressive successes that help win the Cold War.  CORONA was the first successful program in applying space vehicles to overflight reconnaissance operations. In its several evolutionary versions, CORONA steadily improved its photographic surveys of denied areas (with final resolutions of six to ten feet), operating in what the Intelligence Community calls \"search mode.\" GAMBIT was developed to perform at even better resolutions than CORONA and work against specified targets\u2014an operation usually referred to as \"surveillance mode.\" GAMBIT fulfilled this surveillance function from July 1963 to April 1984.  Although Corona provided the capability to search large areas from space, the U.S. still lacked high resolution imagery. Approximately one year after the first launch of Corona, the National Reconnaissance Office began development of its first high resolution satellite program, codenamed Gambit. Over time, the Gambit program evolved into two different systems. The first Gambit system, launched in 1963, was equipped with the KH-7 camera system that included a 77-inch focal length camera for providing specific information on scientific and technical capabilities that threatened the nation. Intelligence users often characterized this capability as surveillance, allowing the United States to track the advancement of Soviet and others' capabilities. The second system, Gambit 3 was equipped with the KH-8 camera system that included a 175-inch focal length camera. The system was first launched in 1966 and provided the U.S. with exquisite surveillance capabilities from space for nearly two decades. The NRO launched a final system, codenamed Hexagon, in 1971 to improve upon Corona's capability to search broad and wide denied areas for threats to the United States. The system sometimes carried a mapping camera to aid in U.S. military war planning. The United States depended on these search and surveillance satellites to understand the capabilities, intentions, and advancements of those who opposed the United States during the Cold War. Together they became America's essential eyes in space.  Here is an excerpt from one of the documents about Gambit: \"Earlier in the day the launch crew had notified Greer that during the final checkout they had uncovered a fault in the Atlas booster that would either force delay or cause reliance on a component not tested to the extent required by specifications. Shouldering aside the oppressive memory of unbroken failures and \"partial successes\" in the E-5 and E-6 programs, Greer ordered continuation of the countdown. It was a personal decision, taken without consultation with others, based as much on instinct as on the confidence of a program director who had done all that could be done to insure success. For an instant during the launch itself, most observers experienced the horrified conviction that the decision had been wrong, that disaster had come again to the Air Force satellite reconnaissance program. The splashing rocket exhaust of the Atlas knocked out all electrical connections to telemetry and cameras, giving the impression of a major launch stand explosion to observers at Sunnyvale and El Segundo. But seconds later the signals began to come through again, and they said that the Atlas was climbing stolidly toward its selected launch window.\"", "trackName": "20th Century Spy in the Sky Satellites: Secrets of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) Volume 1 - Gambit Photoreconnaissance Satellite 1963-1984", "trackId": 474997690, "price": 9.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/2c/48/f0/mzi.tukpkivu.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2011-10-03T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 409275485, "artistIds": ["list", 409275485], "artworkUrl60": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/2c/48/f0/mzi.tukpkivu.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "20th Century Spy in the Sky Satellites: Secrets of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) Volume 1 - Gambit Photoreconnaissance Satellite 1963-1984", "artistName": "Dik Daso", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/20th-century-spy-in-sky-satellites/id474997690?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Engineering", "Books", "Professional & Technical", "History", "Military"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/idnull?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "9020", "38"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "The 3Musketeers are building a huge space carousel escalator so as to enable use of GEO to save civilization and restore the collapsed ecosystem, but they are thwarted by the Elite's TANFL Corp.

In great measure this chronology is the story of dedicated professional men who were attempting to discover the capabilities and limitations of new forms of air and aerospace power and to relate these new characteristics of military power to the defense of the United States and its national interests.

Crashing through a chain-link gate into the 24th Marine Amphibious Unit\u2019s headquarters compound, it drove into the open atrium lobby of a terminal building where hundreds of sleeping Americans were housed. Seconds later, 12,000 pounds of high explosives piled in the bed of the truck exploded. The four-story steel and concrete building shuddered, then collapsed. Two hundred forty-one Americans were killed and many more were  injured in the attack.\n\nSoon after the 24th MAU returned to the United States in November 1983, the Marine Corps granted Eric Hammel an unprecedented opportunity to interview survivors of the bombing and those who came to their rescue. The Root is the highly charged result, a detailed narrative account of the Marines\u2019 mission in Lebanon. It describes escalating involvement in largely unreported battles fought in and around the shattered city of Beirut. And it presents in detail the terrorist attack on the unit headquarters.\n\nThe focus of The Root is on the nearly 200 people interviewed by the author\u2014enlisted men and officers\u2014for whom the shock and horror at the bombing were still fresh. Their reactions to the danger, what they survived and how they survived it, their concerns and insights, make The Root a timeless chronicle of the human spirit\u2014and as timely as today\u2019s headlines.\n\nPraise for The Root\n\n \u201cIllustrates Washington\u2019s exceptional resistance to accepting the facts that contradict its preconceived views. . . .

Longitudinal studies of visitor behavior in wildland recreation settings have been relatively rare but offer great potential for the improvement of management, clarification of conceptual problems and the generation of new research questions previously unconsidered in the outdoor recreation literature. This study aggregates data from two representative surveys of overnight backcountry hiking permit holders at GCNP. The first the first survey was conducted in 1984 and the second was conducted in 2004. This study explores how the population has changed in terms of hiker characteristics, the characteristics of their visits, and the experiences achieved on hiker visits. To assess the effect of changes in hikers&apos; characteristics on the characteristics of their visits, and the experience outcomes of their visits, the data were analyzed using an Age-Period-Cohort (APC) framework. In the APC framework, longitudinal change is a function of three causal forces: differences in the life-course positions of visitors, differences in the historical circumstances of the research, and differences in the preferences and characteristics of the cohorts that make up the populations. The results indicate that visitors in 2004 were older, more experienced hikers and were more likely to hike with family members than other group types than were hikers in 1984. There was remarkable stability in the outcomes sought by hikers, although the relative importance of family related outcomes increased modestly. APC analysis suggested that differences in social groups and experience outcome importance between hikers in 1984 and 2004 are related to the age differences of the hiker populations. This study broadens the understanding of visitor populations, has implications for management and researchers, reaffirms that just as with ecological systems, visitor populations are dynamic and that monitoring the social systems within wildland recreation areas is important for the maintenance and improvement of the quality of visitor experiences.", "trackName": "Changing People, Consistent Experiences: 20 Years Of Change And Stability At Grand Canyon National Park 1984-2004", "trackId": 521420833, "price": 39.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/a5/71/79/a5717972-a9e6-0cbc-6939-b3409ea1b1be/9781109571059.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2012-04-21T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 521420836, "artistIds": ["list", 521420836], "artworkUrl60": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/a5/71/79/a5717972-a9e6-0cbc-6939-b3409ea1b1be/9781109571059.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Changing People, Consistent Experiences: 20 Years Of Change And Stability At Grand Canyon National Park 1984-2004", "artistName": "Erik A.

Dallas, a Jelmo shareholder and director, converted the money in the escrow accounts to their personal use. The checks were never delivered to Lyco. Based on this information, Lyco amended its original petition to add the First National Bank of Amarillo (the Bank), appellee, as a defendant. Lyco alleged a cause of action against the Bank for conversion. The Bank, however, moved for summary judgment and the trial court granted the Banks motion, severing Lycos cause of action against the Bank from Lycos cause of action against Jelmo and others.

He's not a criminal, and not violent, but very disruptive as he attempts to make the world a better place -- in his own bizarre ways.  Written to take place in the sixties or early seventies when \"free love\" and drugs were a way of life, Elaine becomes a runaway when her parents try to curb her drug use and her boyfriend invites other women into his bedroom. As a teenage runaway she is scooped up by a hospital that is profiting from government subsidies per each additional patient.  Thumper and Elaine develop a romantic relationship in the hospital but the love affair becomes complicated when Elaine and the Head Nurse have a romantic lesbian love affair.   Thumper is kept under control with experimental dream therapy drugs to keep him away from Elaine, by the Head Nurse, similar to Nurse Cratchet of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey.    Without drugs, Thumper hallucinates for self-defense.  What makes his visions exciting, is that other people can see them also as they are transformed into the character's of Thumper's visions.  This music movie ROCK OPERA was originally a series of music videos that were performed on many Los Angeles stages and various nightclubs like Madame Wong's from 1985 to 1989.  Michael J. Fox and director Steven Spielberg gave compliments to the script and showed interest in the rock opera that was rewritten into the Coyote In A Graveyard feature film screenplay for New World Pictures.  Although Michael J. Fox asked for the starring role, the movie has yet to be produced.  This ebook is the FINAL 3rd DRAFT of 1985 made for New World Pictures, but halted in preproduction when they ceased movie production that year to specialize in television dramas only.  The soundtrack for the movie was recorded by the original cast musicians: The Coyote on bass, guitars, and vocals (now known as The Hippy Coyote of American Zen), Bruce Candelaria on drums, and Scott Hitchings on keyboards.

Over the next eighteen years, Youth Corps built a diverse network of programs that consciously drew upon the inductive theology of Vatican II that promoted Catholics to be actively engaged in the world. Youth Corps showcased the prophetic voice of Catholic social justice activists through highly successful \"Events\"; nurtured healthy families through Christian Family Peace Weekends; recognized the dignity of the city's physically handicapped and the imprisoned; and helped Catholics to see Christ in the poor of the inner city and the global south. While tens of thousands of young adults participated in these ministries, Youth Corps' social activism would expose ecclesiological tensions over pastoral strategy that challenged the Archdiocese of Toronto--and the Canadian Catholic Church--during the 1980s.

Tandis que des dizaines de milliers de jeunes adultes participaient a ces ministeres, l'activisme des Brigades jeunesse devoilait les tensions religieuses sur la strategie pastorale qui mettaient a rude epreuve le diocese de Toronto--ainsi que l'Eglise catholique canadienne--durant les annees 80.", "trackName": "Rooted in the Vision of Vatican II: Youth Corps and the Formation of Christ-Centered Social Activists in Toronto, 1966-1984 (Report)", "trackId": 521455542, "price": 5.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/4c/c9/29/4cc92946-5716-a36a-4d23-21ab44a35e53/236631116.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2010-01-01T08:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 485337901, "artistIds": ["list", 485337901], "artworkUrl60": "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/4c/c9/29/4cc92946-5716-a36a-4d23-21ab44a35e53/236631116.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Rooted in the Vision of Vatican II: Youth Corps and the Formation of Christ-Centered Social Activists in Toronto, 1966-1984 (Report)", "artistName": "Historical Studies", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/rooted-in-vision-vatican-ii/id521455542?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "History", "Books"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/robert-leon/id522003768?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "9031", "38"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "Democracy?\n<p>The death of democracy is not likely to be an assassination from ambush.

Summary: The Roman Catholic Church pays for a long time attention on its media image, a link between the institution and the public sphere. This article focuses on the distance between ecclesiastical discourse and the Quebecois public opinion during a period of profound transformation of the society.

In these thorough reports, with information and specifics not available on NASA website mission descriptions, each orbiter system is reviewed in detail along with technical information on performance and anomalies.  STS-7: The STS-7 flight was launched on June 18, 1983 and landed at Edwards AFB, CA. The crew for this flight, the largest number ever flown, were Captain R. L. Crippen, Commander; Captain F. H. Hauck, Pilot; and Colonel J. M. Fabian and S. K. Ride, PhD., Mission Specialists; and N. E. Thagard, M.D., Medical Specialist.  STS-8: The STS-8 flight was launched on August 30, 1983 and landed at Edwards on September 6. STS-8 provided the first night launch and landing of the Program. The crew for this fourth operational flight was Capt. R. H. Truly, Commander; Cdr. D. C. Brandenstein, Pilot; Lt. Col. G. S. Bluford, and Lt. Cdr. D. A. Gardner, Mission Specialists; and W. E. Thornton, M.D., Medical Specialist.  STS-9: The STS-9 flight, the first flight of the European-Space-Agency built Spacelab, was launched on November 28, 198 and landed at Edwards on December 8, 1983. This flight was launched on the most northern inclination (57 deg.) of any U.S. manned flight. The 6-man crew for this Spacelab mission, the largest crew ever flown, was composed of four astronauts and two non-astronaut payload specialists, one of whom was the first foreign person to be launched by the U.S.  STS 41-B: The STS-41B flight was launched from Launch Complex 39 and landed at the KSC SLF on February 11, 1984. This flight ended with the completion of one of the last major test objectives of the program, that of landing at the Kennedy Space Center.  STS 41-C: The STS 41-C flight was launched on April 6, 1984 and landed at Edwards on April 13, 1984. This flight was scheduled as a 6-day mission, but SMM retrieval problems during flight day 3 operations resulted in extending the mission 1 day for a total of 7 days. Also, this flight was scheduled to land at the Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility; however, the possibility of adverse weather (rain) resulted in a decision to land at Edwards AFB, California.  STS-41-D: The STS 41-D mission, the first for the OV-103 vehicle, Discovery, was scheduled for launch on June 25, 1984, and June 26, 1984, and August 29, 1984. The attempted launch on June 25, 1984, was scrubbed because GPC-5 (general purpose computer-5), which contained the backup flight system software, exhibited two memory parity errors at T-32 minutes.  STS 41-G: The STS 41-G mission, the sixth flight for the OV-099 vehicle, Challenger, was launched from Launch Complex 39A on October 5, 1984. In the areas of payloads and experiments, all except the SIR (Shuttle Imaging Radar) accomplished essentially all of their objectives. The crew for this flight were Robert L. Crippen, Captain, USN, Commander; Jon A. McBride, Commander, USN, Pilot; Sally K. Ride, PhD., Kathryn D. Sullivan, PhD., and David C. Leetsma, Lt. Cdr., USN, Mission Specialists; Paul D. Scully-Power, PhD., Payload Specialist; and Marc Garneau, PhD., Canadian Payload Specialist.  STS 51-A: The STS 51-A mission was scheduled for launch on November 7, 1984, but the launch was scrubbed during the planned hold at T-20 minutes because the data indicated that the predicted winds-aloft would apply shear loads in excess of the design limits of the vehicle. The final countdown culminated in a successful launch from launch complex 39A on November 8, 1984, and the mission was completed with a landing at the KSC SLF on November 16, 1984.", "trackName": "Space Shuttle NASA Mission Reports: 1983 and 1984 Missions, STS-7, STS-8, STS-9, STS 41-B, STS 41-C, STS-41-D, STS 41-G, STS 51-A", "trackId": 492196981, "price": 9.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/aa/98/ac/mzi.wmlkdypn.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2011-12-22T08:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 409275485, "artistIds": ["list", 409275485], "artworkUrl60": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/aa/98/ac/mzi.wmlkdypn.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Space Shuttle NASA Mission Reports: 1983 and 1984 Missions, STS-7, STS-8, STS-9, STS 41-B, STS 41-C, STS-41-D, STS 41-G, STS 51-A", "artistName": "Dik Daso", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/space-shuttle-nasa-mission/id492196981?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Astronomy", "Books", "Science & Nature", "History", "Americas"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/carl-djerassi/id214745753?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "10093", "38", "9031", "9008"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "Am 8. Mai 1983 wird Carl Djerassi von der gro\u00dfen Liebe seines Lebens, Diane Middlebrook, verlassen. Der Naturwissenschaftler und &quot;Vater der Pille&quot; macht sich an ein f\u00fcr ihn neuartiges Experiment: Gekr\u00e4nkt und ungl\u00fccklich nimmt er Rache in Form einer &quot;poetischen Vulkaneruption&quot;. Er beginnt, Gedichte zu schreiben, die in jeder Hinsicht offen sind - zum einen, weil sie einen h\u00f6chst pers\u00f6nlichen und intimen Einblick in die Gef\u00fchlswelt Djerassis erlauben, zum anderen, weil sie formal frei gestaltet sind. <br />\nDieser Gedichtband ist das lyrische Tagebuch eines Mannes, der voll Zorn und Selbstmitleid, aber auch mit schonungsloser Ehrlichkeit das Ende seiner Beziehung betrauert, bis Diane 1984 zu ihm zur\u00fcckkehrt und ihn wenig sp\u00e4ter heiratet. Erst mehrere Jahre nach ihrem Tod 2007 hat sich Djerassi abermals mit diesen Gedichten besch\u00e4ftigt und sie \u00fcberarbeitet. Das Zusammenspiel seiner beiden Lebenssprachen er\u00f6ffnet neue Blickwinkel auf den Wissenschaftler, den Kunstkenner und vor allem auf den Menschen Carl Djerassi.<br />\nOn May 8th 1983, Carl Djerassi was left by the great love of his life, the biographer Diane Middlebrook. The scientist, sometimes called the &quot;Father of the Pill,\u0094 embarks on a totally new experiment: Wounded and despondent, he takes revenge in the form of a &quot;poetic volcanic eruption.\u0094 He starts writing brutally open poems in free verse - brutally open, in that they allow a deeply personal and intimate insight into Djerassi&#39;s emotional world. <br />\nThis German-English poetry volume is the lyrical diary of a man, full of anger and self-pity, who grieves with unsparing honesty about the end of a relationship, until unexpectedly Diane Middlebrook returns to him in 1984 and becomes his wife. Only some years after her death in 2007 did Djerassi return again to these poems to revise and partly rewrite them. The bilingual interplay between his mother tongue and his adopted literary language provides a new perspective on the scientist, the art connoisseur and especially the persona of Carl Djerassi.", "trackName": "Tagebuch des Grolls.

Shortly thereafter, I ran across an article entitled \"Realms of Fantasy: An Interview with Diana Wynne Jones\" by Fiona Lafferty. Writing of Archer's Goon, Lafferty explained, \"that this book was written in 1984 was no accident. Diana Wynne Jones intended this fantastic idea to act as a metaphor for what happens in real life, where governments can control people\" (4). If I remember correctly, my original reaction to reading this quotation was one of surprise. I loved the novel as a wacky, imaginative, thought-provoking study of family dynamics, but apparently the author herself had stated that at least parts of the book were actually about politics and bad government.   It took me years to realize it was not a coincidence that a novel about the abuse of political power and Orwellian government also dealt in depth with family relationships. Of course, Jones herself makes the point quite plainly in the novel. When Archer places the words \"Archer is watching you\" on the television that he also uses to spy on the Sykes family (33), he is not only borrowing his surveillance tactics from 1984 but also quite literally mimicking the slogan \"Big Brother is watching you\" (Orwell 5)--for Archer is the eldest brother in his family. However, Archer's use of the slogan while watching the Sykes family ultimately turns out to be ironic. Although he is, in fact, Howard Sykes's big brother, he differs from the omniscient Party in 1984 in his lack of awareness of such an important fact, an ignorance that demonstrates that his surveillance does not provide him with total knowledge of the people he watches.", "trackName": "Little Sister is Watching You: Archer's Goon and 1984", "trackId": 483369309, "price": 5.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/ee/52/91/mzi.ipukfhcq.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2011-03-22T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 483369283, "artistIds": ["list", 483369283], "artworkUrl60": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/ee/52/91/mzi.ipukfhcq.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Little Sister is Watching You: Archer's Goon and 1984", "artistName": "Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/little-sister-is-watching/id483369309?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Language Arts & Disciplines", "Books", "Professional & Technical", "Education"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/hispanofila/id485314983?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "11009", "38", "9029", "10037"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "Encinar, Angeles y Kathleen M.

Asimismo, los ensayos acercan al lector contemporaneo no solo a cuestiones formales que conciernen a las obras estudiadas, asi como a la propia trayectoria de sus autores, sino que ademas recogen otras problematicas politico-sociales abordadas con interes en la actualidad por la literatura, entre ellas la identidad (cultural, sexual, nacional), la recuperacion de la memoria historica o el compromiso social y etico de los novelistas con el imaginario nacional.", "trackName": "Encinar, Angeles y Kathleen M.

Estimates suggest that as many as 30,000 people may have died as a result of the military state's terror tactics, the majority of them kidnapped, tortured, and disappeared. As a result of the traumatic experience of military rule, the spectre of dictatorship has never really left Argentina. As of the early twenty-first century, government officials still referred to Argentina's ongoing 'transitional democracy' in their reports and findings. (1) Argentine anthropologist Sofia Tiscornia underlines the point, asserting that change is only in process in Argentina, that it has not been accomplished. 'The past coexists with us in the present,' she states. 'An ex-torturer is today governor of Tucuman, [former torturers] are candidates for elections, collaborators lead journalistic programmes, and they look like pillars of democracy'. (2) As Argentine writer Griselda Gambaro highlights, it is as hard to imagine Argentina without the dictatorship as it is to imagine Germany without Adolf Hitler. (3) Argentine novelist Alicia Kozameh addresses the same point. 'In my country, there is [no such thing as] 'post-authoritarianism,\" she writes. 'The concept does not work... My country does not fit the category'. She acknowledges that she can accept the label of 'post-dictatorship' to describe the state of Argentina in the years since its transition to democracy, but that 'post-authoritarian' is inappropriate. 'There are many things going on in my country,' Kozameh states, 'and they are all related to authoritarianism'. (4) At the time of this article's writing, just over twenty years have passed since Argentina began its transition to democracy, and yet, many agree, most of the issues that made the dictatorship possible have not been dealt with adequately. 'The 'blood' memory and unspeakable horrors of the past reappear as a recurring obsession,' sociologist Laura Kalmanowiecki notes, 'even among those who want to heal society's wounds'.' (5) Kozameh agrees; the democracy, she argues, was founded on the basis of forgetting what she labels the 'genocide' of the military dictatorship of 1976 to 1983. 'We need to remember first,' she states. 'We need justice first'.

Nearly 4 decades later, the cost has skyrocketed to nearly 20 times the cost at $6,675 per person and is ranked last when compared to other industrialized nations. In addition, Americans have the most expensive care in the world in return for the fewest services. Low reimbursements and a burdensome liability system with huge malpractice insurance costs are driving American doctors out of business in record numbers.   \nThis book introduces a radical new plan in 3 steps to bring America into line with the rest of the industrialized world with regard to cost, availability and quality of service.

Anatheism refers to an inaugural event that lies at the heart of every great religion, a wager between hospitality and hostility to the stranger, the other&#38; mdash;the sense of something \"more.\" By analyzing the roots of our own anatheistic moment, Kearney shows not only how a return to God is possible for those who seek it but also how a more liberating faith can be born. </P><P>Kearney begins by locating a turn toward sacred secularity in contemporary philosophy, focusing on Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Paul Ricoeur.

That's what Gene Baur had been told -- but when he first visited a stockyard he realized that this rosy depiction couldn't be more inaccurate.  <P> Amid the stench, noise, and filth, his attention was drawn in particular to one sheep who had been cast aside for dead. But as Baur walked by, the sheep raised her head and looked right at him. She was still alive, and the one thing Baur knew for sure that day was that he had to get her to safety. Hilda, as she was later named, was nursed back to health and soon became the first resident of Farm Sanctuary -- an organization dedicated to the rescue, care, and protection of farm animals.  <P> The truth is that farm production does not depend on the family farmer with a small herd of animals but instead resembles a large, assembly-line factory. Animals raised for human consumption are confined for the entirety of their lives and often live without companionship, fresh air, or even adequate food and water.Viewed as production units rather than living beings with feelings, ten billion farm animals are exploited specifically for food in the United States every year.  <P> In <I>Farm Sanctuary</i>, Baur provides a thoughtprovoking investigation of the ethical questions involved in the production of beef, poultry, pork, milk,and eggs -- and what each of us can do to stop the mistreatment of farm animals and promote compassion. He details the triumphs and the disappointments of more than twenty years on the front lines of the animal protection movement. And he introduces sanctuary. us to some of the special creatures who live at Farm Sanctuary -- from Maya the cow to Marmalade the chicken -- all of whom escaped horrible circumstances to live happier, more peaceful lives. <I>Farm Sanctuary</i> shows how all of us have an opportunity and a responsibility to consume a kinder plate, making a better life for ourselves and animals as well.

The attraction closed in 1987 and a bit of Americana faded away, but its memory remains vivid to many. The property was sold to the state for the development of a highway, which never materialized. In 2009, after years of negotiations, the town purchased the land from the New Hampshire Department of Transportation with plans to develop it into a large park filled with picnic areas, walking paths, and bicycle trails.

Not only does locally produced raw milk replace imported dairy products, it provides some degree of national food security to counteract the vagrancies of the current global financial and politically unstable world in which we live (APHCA, 2007). Dairy consumption in Asia has more than doubled over the last 25 years, and this has led to more than 50% of the world's total dairy imports now entering Asian markets (FAOSTAT, 2008).

In addition, the popularity of natural and organic foods is increasing as many consumers seek what they perceive as safer and more nutritious food produced under sustainable and ethical conditions, especially as regards animal welfare. The principles of organic livestock production have been formulated by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) and were included in EU regulation 2092/91 in the year 2000. Organic farming is based on principles which explicitly state that animal welfare is a high priority (Lund, 2006). \"Organic foods\" in the USA have been defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (7CFR205) with standards set as to which processes and synthetic substances are acceptable for production and handling in order for foods to be certified as organic. Thus \"organic\" is a production claim and not a food safety claim. In the UK, organic farming standards include the feeding of a minimum of 60% of the dry matter intake as forage, and aim to provide a basis for optimal dairy cow comfort and health (Anon, 2005). Recent years have seen an increase in the number of dairy farms that have converted to organic farming. Organically farmed cows are fed with foodstuffs grown without pesticides and are subject to different EU regulations on housing standards and the use of veterinary medicines (CEC, 2004). The principles behind organic production and many organic producer groups suggest that more attention is paid to animal welfare on organic farms than on non-organic farms (Sundrum, 2001).", "trackName": "Milk Quality and Antimicrobial Resistance Against Mastitis Pathogens After Changing from a Conventional to an Experimentally Organic Dairy Farm (Report)", "trackId": 523067627, "price": 5.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/77/c9/33/77c93308-fa74-12f9-fdd7-17ccaaf3aae0/225314875.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2010-05-01T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 483359281, "artistIds": ["list", 483359281], "artworkUrl60": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/77/c9/33/77c93308-fa74-12f9-fdd7-17ccaaf3aae0/225314875.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Milk Quality and Antimicrobial Resistance Against Mastitis Pathogens After Changing from a Conventional to an Experimentally Organic Dairy Farm (Report)", "artistName": "Asian - Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/milk-quality-antimicrobial/id523067627?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Industries & Professions", "Books", "Business & Personal Finance"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/lisa-taylor-gardeners-seattle/id482930261?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "10068", "38", "9024"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "<p><b>The most complete book on urban farming, covering everything from growing organic produce and raising chickens, to running a small farm on a city lot or in a suburban backyard.</b></p><p>Eating locally and growing one's own food is a rapidly evolving movement in urban settings - Hantz Farms in Detroit has transformed 70 acres of abandoned properties into energy-efficient gardens, and Eagle Street Rooftop Farm, a 6,000-foot vegetable farm in Brooklyn, New York, yields 30 different kinds of produce, while private square-foot farms are cropping up in cities all over the country.</p><p>Created by Lisa Taylor and the gardeners of Seattle Tilth, <i>Your Farm in the City</i> covers all of the essential information specific to gardening and farming in a city or town.

Now, he focuses exclusively on the contained world of the farm animal, revealing startling, irrefutable evidence that barnyard creatures have feelings too, even consciousness.<br><br>Weaving history, literature, anecdotes, scientific studies, and Masson&#8217;s own vivid experiences observing pigs, cows, sheep, goats, and chickens over the course of five years, this important book at last gives voice, meaning, and dignity to these gentle beasts that are bred to be milked, shorn, butchered, and eaten. Can we ever know what makes an animal happy? Many animal behaviorists say no. But Jeffrey Masson has a different view: An animal is happy if it can live according to its own nature. Farm animals suffer greatly in this regard. Chickens, for instance, like to perch in trees at night, to avoid predators and to nestle with friends. The obvious conclusion: They cannot be happy when confined twenty to a cage. <br><br>From field and barn, to pen and coop, Masson bears witness to the emotions and intelligence of these remarkable farm animals, each unique with distinct qualities. Curious, intelligent, self-reliant&#8211;many will find it hard to believe that these attributes describe a pig. In fact, there is much that humans share with pigs. They dream, know their names, and can see colors. Mother cows mourn the loss of their calves when their babies are taken away to slaughter. Given a choice between food that is nutritious or lacking in minerals, sheep will select the former, balancing their diet and correcting the deficiency. Goats display quite a sense of humor, dignity, and fearlessness (Indian goats have been known to kill leopards). Chickens are naturally sociable&#8211;they will gather around a human companion and stand there serenely preening themselves or sit quietly on the ground beside someone they trust.<br><br>For far too long farm animals have been denigrated and treated merely as creatures of instinct rather than as sentient beings.

In Anthem, Rand examines a frightening future in which individuals have no name, no independence, and no values. Equality 7-2521 lives in the dark ages of the future where all decisions are made by committee, all people live in collectives, and all traces of individualism have been wiped out. Despite such a restrictive environment, the spark of individual thought and freedom still burns in him--a passion which he has been taught to call sinful. In a purely egalitarian world, Equality 7-2521 dares to stand apart from the herd--to think and choose for himself, to discover electricity, and to love the woman of his choice. Now he has been marked for death for committing the ultimate sin. In a world where the great \"we\" reign supreme, he has rediscovered the lost and holy word--\"I\".<br/>", "trackName": "Anthem", "trackId": 417606728, "price": 0.99, "artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/ayn-rand/id2028515?mt=11&uo=4", "artworkUrl100": "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/b2/78/91/mzi.ruiafkif.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2011-01-29T08:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 2028515, "userRatingCount": 2, "averageUserRating": 3.0, "artworkUrl60": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/b2/78/91/mzi.ruiafkif.60x60-50.jpg", "artistIds": ["list", 2028515], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/anthem/id417606728?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Fiction & Literature", "Books", "Classics"]}, {"trackCensoredName": "Anthem", "genreIds": ["list", "10042", "38", "9031"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "In a future where misguided egalitarianism has reduced a once-vibrant civilization to a handful of doctrinaire serfs living in the rubble of what once was, Equality 7-2521 rejects the mindless collectivism of his people to embrace individuality. His curiosity about the mysteries of the past is anathema to those selected to rule; Equality's rejection of his assigned menial role is if anything an even greater affront to his master. Forced by the lesser men around him to flee, Equality and his lover, Liberty 5-3000, find refuge in a conveniently preserved chalet, free to rediscover eternal truths suppressed by their totalitarian forefathers. Adapted from Rand's 1938 novella, Staton's art is oddly crude for such a veteran artist, but oddly well suited for Rand's clumsy, hectoring story. The product of a time when authoritarian regimes seemed destined to prevail, written by a refugee from the Russian revolution, Anthem might have been a valuable reminder of what happens when ideology trumps humanitarian concerns, but sadly, Rand was not up to the task; Santino and Staton do what they can with this dismal tribute to egotism, but the result is still a hard slog.", "trackName": "Anthem", "trackId": 510902306, "price": 4.99, "artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/ayn-rand/id2028515?mt=11&uo=4", "artworkUrl100": "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/de/10/1f/de101f94-33e5-1b97-4404-0495d19175de/9781607960720.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2009-07-26T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 2028515, "artistIds": ["list", 2028515], "artworkUrl60": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/de/10/1f/de101f94-33e5-1b97-4404-0495d19175de/9781607960720.60x60-50.jpg", "artistName": "Ayn Rand", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/anthem/id510902306?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Classics", "Books", "Fiction & Literature"]}, {"trackCensoredName": "The Cop and the Anthem / \u0424\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043e\u043d \u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043b", "genreIds": ["list", "10066", "38", "9033", "9031", "10042"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "\u0427\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437 \u041e. \u0413\u0435\u043d\u0440\u0438 \u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0432\u0443\u044f\u0437\u044b\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0438. \u041d\u0430\u0436\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0443\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434.<br>\n\u0414\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0443\u044f\u0437\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0432 iBookstore \u043f\u043e \u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0443 \u00abDoppeltext\u00bb. \u041f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f: <a href=\"http://www.doppeltext.com\">www.doppeltext.com</a>.<br>\n* * * * *<br>\nRead the short story by O.

Using a pseudonym to hide the fact he was a prisoner, O. Henry became his best known name, and he used it for hundreds of short stories written between 1902-1910, when he died of cirrhosis of the liver due to heavy drinking.\u00a0<br>\nThis edition of O.

Biographies are people's lives narrated by others. However, the act of writing the lives of the nation in the form of an anthem, and then projecting these experiences as epitomising the lives of the individuals within the nation, is in fact marked by a disjuncture. This happens because by their very nature, acts of narrating individual or collective identities should always be viewed as approximations of that lived reality. Furthermore, national anthems as wish lists are based on some selected themes deemed of national importance by others and not everybody. This problem is at the heart of reading the Zimbabwean national anthem as a political biography. This article argues that if it is remembered that the lyrics of Simudzai Mureza weZimbabwe were composed by a literary figure, and selected and adopted by the Government of Zimbabwe, amongst other compositions, then there is reason to believe that there are, from that competition, some versions of the national anthem that were turned down, whose lyrical content Zimbabweans may never come to know of. Read from this \"subversive\" perspective, the Zimbabwean national anthem is a political biography \"complete in its incompleteness\" or incomplete in its completeness.

My brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, and I decided to write a song to be sung at the exercise. I wrote the words and he wrote the music. Our New York publisher, Edward B. Marks, made mimeographed copies for us and the song was taught to and sung by a chorus of five hundred colored school children.<br> <br>&quot;Shortly afterwards my brother and I moved from Jacksonville to New York, and the song passed out of our minds. But the school children of Jacksonville kept singing it, they went off to other schools and sang it, they became teachers and taught it to other children. Within twenty years it was being sung over the South and in some other parts of the country. Today, the song, popularly known as the Negro National Hymn, is quite generally used.<br> <br>&quot;The lines of this song repay me in elation, almost of exquisite anguish, whenever I hear them sung by Negro children.&quot;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br><br>&#8212;James Weldon Johnson, 1935<br><br>Pasted into Bibles, schoolbooks, and hearts, &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing,&quot; written by J.

Readers are given unprecedented access&#151;from the draft room to the locker room to the sidelines&#151;and insights into why Belichick is considered to be the NFL&#146;s best coach and premier strategist.</p>\n<p>\nBefore he achieved success, though, Belichick was barely surviving as a coach. <i>War Room</i> opens in Cleveland, where Belichick, a young head coach,&#160;worked in&#160;an office with&#160;two employees in their late twenties: Pioli, a low-paid scouting assistant, and&#160;Dimitroff, a groundskeeper and part-time scout. After Belichick was fired by the Browns in 1996, the three men were in separate cities and seemingly a lifetime away from being recognized as leaders and&#160;champions. But soon they were reunited in New England, where they refined and burnished Belichick&#146;s method for constructing a winning team, overseeing one of the greatest franchises in modern NFL history. </p>\n<p>\nThese three master strategists are now competitors. Belichick continues at the helm of the New England Patriots, while Pioli is now in charge of the Kansas City Chiefs and Dimitroff is running the Atlanta Falcons. And even though they no longer work for the same franchise, they do have a common&#160;goal: building the perfect team, one draft pick and one trade at a time. </p>\n<p>\n<i>War Room</i> is their unique and often astonishing story. It is packed with never-been-told anecdotes and new observations from team officials, players, coaches, and scouts, all leading to surprising and groundbreaking insights into the art of building a champion.&#160;</p>", "trackName": "War Room", "trackId": 431811045, "price": 12.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/98/58/80/mzi.bqagmiar.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2011-11-08T08:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 361806277, "userRatingCount": 128, "averageUserRating": 4.0, "artworkUrl60": "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/98/58/80/mzi.bqagmiar.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "War Room", "artistIds": ["list", 361806277], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/war-room/id431811045?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Football", "Books", "Sports & Outdoors"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/niccolo-machiavelli-henry/id370187278?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "9015", "38"], "kind": "ebook", "artistName": "Niccolo Machiavelli, Henry Neville (Translator)", "description": "<p>The Art of War was written between 1519 and 1520 and published the following \nyear, it was the only historical or political work printed during Machiavelli's \nlifetime.

(Some scholars believe it was written during the later Warring States period. Composed of 13 chapters, each of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare, it is said to be the definitive work on military strategies and tactics of its time, and still one of the basic texts.<br>\n<br>\n<i>The Art of War</i> is one of the oldest and most successful books on military strategy. It has had an influence on Eastern military thinking, business tactics, and beyond. Sun Tzu suggested the importance of positioning in strategy and that position is affected both by objective conditions in the physical environment and the subjective opinions of competitive actors in that environment. He thought that strategy was not planning in the sense of working through an established list, but rather that it requires quick and appropriate responses to changing conditions. Planning works in a controlled environment, but in a changing environment, competing plans collide, creating unexpected situations.<br>\n<br>\nThe book was translated into the French language in 1772 by French Jesuit Jean Joseph Marie Amiot, and into English by British officer Everard Ferguson Calthrop in 1905. Leaders as diverse as Mao Zedong, General Vo Nguyen Giap, Baron Antoine-Henri Jomini, and General Douglas MacArthur have claimed to have drawn inspiration from the work. <i>The Art of War</i> has also been applied to business and managerial strategies.<br>\n<br>\n<b>FEATURES:</b><br>\n<b></b><br>\n\t\u2022\tIncludes beautiful illustrations from the original book\u00a0<br>\n\t\u2022\tA link of a FREE audio book to download at the end of the book<br>\n\t\u2022\tActive Table of Contents for an easy navigation within the book<br>\n\t\u2022\tSaves space and don\u2019t have to carry a hard copy around<br>\n\t\u2022\tOffers an easy access and convenience to this classic literary masterpiece for a reasonable price<br>\n\t\u2022\tGives a lasting entertainment and values for readers of all ages", "trackName": "The Art of War", "trackId": 505874297, "price": 0.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/80/f2/0e/mzi.dbpfklyh.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2012-02-26T08:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 60737826, "userRatingCount": 3, "averageUserRating": 4.5, "artworkUrl60": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/80/f2/0e/mzi.dbpfklyh.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "The Art of War", "artistIds": ["list", 60737826], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-art-of-war/id505874297?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Military", "Books", "History", "Nonfiction", "Philosophy"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/james-scott-bell/id283480155?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "10104", "38", "9033"], "kind": "ebook", "artistName": "James Scott Bell", "description": "<h2>Strategies and Tactics for the Master Novelist</h2> <p>Successfully starting and finishing a publishable novel is often like fighting a series of battles.

This brilliant adaptation of the ancient masterpiece <i>The Art of War</i> shows women how to use Sun Tzu&#8217;s philosophy to win in every aspect of life.<br></b><br>Would you like to transform your weaknesses into strengths? Succeed at work without compromising your ethics? Integrate your style and personal philosophy into every action you take? If so, this book is for you. In <i>The Art of War for Women, </i>bestselling author Chin-Ning Chu brings the eternal wisdom of philosopher-general Sun Tzu to women looking to gain a better understanding of who they are &#8211; and, more importantly, who they want to be. <br><br>In the West, when we think of war, we imagine battle, casualties, brutality. But Sun Tzu, the man who wrote the Art of War some 2,500 years ago, was Chinese, and the Chinese think of war differently than we do in the West. In their view, war does not revolve around fighting. It is about determining the most efficient way of gaining victory with the least amount of conflict.<br><br>That&#8217;s why Sun Tzu&#8217;s <i>Art of War</i> is particularly appropriate for women. Let&#8217;s face it, as intelligent and accomplished as we may be, there are very few of us who are comfortable with direct confrontation or situations where our triumph means someone else&#8217;s defeat. We are natural negotiators and problem solvers; most of us prefer win-win situations to those in which winner-takes-all.<br><br>But there is another reason <i>The Art of War</i> is particularly appropriate for us. Although Sun Tzu&#8217;s book is about the application of strategies, every one of those strategies begins with having a deep understanding of the people and the world around us. They also require us to understand ourselves &#8211; our strengths and weaknesses, our goals and fears. In other words, the aim is not to apply a series of rules coldly and dispassionately, but rather to integrate ourselves and our unique talents into the strategies we will employ. <br><br>This is not a feel-good book.

Some remember him as the greatest U.S. fighter pilot ever -- the man who, in simulated air-to-air combat, defeated every challenger in less than forty seconds. Some recall him as the father of our country's most legendary fighter aircraft -- the F-15 and F-16. Still others think of Boyd as the most influential military theorist since Sun Tzu. They know only half the story. Boyd, more than any other person, saved fighter aviation from the predations of the Strategic Air Command. His manual of fighter tactics changed the way every air force in the world flies and fights. He discovered a physical theory that forever altered the way fighter planes were designed. Later in life, he developed a theory of military strategy that has been adopted throughout the world and even applied to business models for maximizing efficiency. And in one of the most startling and unknown stories of modern military history, the Air Force fighter pilot taught the U.S. Marine Corps how to fight war on the ground. His ideas led to America's swift and decisive victory in the Gulf War and foretold the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. On a personal level, Boyd rarely met a general he couldn't offend. He was loud, abrasive, and profane. A man of daring, ferocious passion and intractable stubbornness, he was that most American of heroes -- a rebel who cared not for his reputation or fortune but for his country. He was a true patriot, a man who made a career of challenging the shortsighted and self-serving Pentagon bureaucracy. America owes Boyd and his disciples -- the six men known as the \"Acolytes\" -- a great debt. Robert Coram finally brings to light the remarkable story of a man who polarized all who knew him, but who left a legacy that will influence the military -- and all of America -- for decades to come. ..", "trackName": "Boyd", "trackId": 357662355, "price": 9.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/1a/4f/8d/mzi.hbydawtj.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2002-11-21T08:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 365478817, "userRatingCount": 17, "averageUserRating": 4.5, "artworkUrl60": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/1a/4f/8d/mzi.hbydawtj.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Boyd", "artistIds": ["list", 365478817], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/boyd/id357662355?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Biographies & Memoirs", "Books"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/abel-choy/id398433500?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "10119", "38", "9025", "9018", "10107"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "There is a hunger within us for success in life.

Thankfully, that problem is now solved with Everything You Need to Know About Atlas Shrugged, a primer that can get anyone caught up to speed on the plot, characters, themes, symbols, and philosophy of Rand\u2019s classic in 30 minutes.\u00a0<br>\n<br>\nIn addition to covering the book in detail, Everything You Need to Know About Atlas Shrugged includes a biography of Rand\u2019s life, discussion about the inspiration for the novel\u2019s characters, and a full-fledged explanation of Objectivism and the sources of Rand\u2019s political philosophy.\u00a0<br>\n<br>\nWith Atlas Shrugged and its underlying themes as relevant as ever today, get caught up quick with this resourceful guide. \u00a0<br>", "trackName": "Everything You Need to Know About Atlas Shrugged", "trackId": 530981943, "price": 2.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/43/2c/90/432c9025-551c-f072-7abf-f82ebd3521e2/EYNTN---atlas-shrugged_03.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2012-05-26T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 421675931, "userRatingCount": 4, "averageUserRating": 4.5, "artworkUrl60": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/43/2c/90/432c9025-551c-f072-7abf-f82ebd3521e2/EYNTN---atlas-shrugged_03.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Everything You Need to Know About Atlas Shrugged", "artistIds": ["list", 421675931], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/everything-you-need-to-know/id530981943?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Classics", "Books", "Fiction & Literature", "Politics & Current Events"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/don-milne/id466798157?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "9031", "38"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "New angel George is assigned to work for angel Clarence in Heaven's Prayerless Souls Department, where they file the names of all those no one prays for.

In an instant, this private cataclysm drives his life into before and after, a threshold that can never be uncrossed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis parents' arrest and imprisonment mean a threatening and uncertain future for Dell and his twin sister, Berner. Willful and burning with resentment, Berner flees their home in Montana, abandoning her brother and her life. But Dell is not completely alone. A family friend intervenes, spiriting him across the Canadian border, in hopes of delivering him to a better life. There, afloat on the prairie of Saskatchewan, Dell is taken in by Arthur Remlinger, an enigmatic and charismatic American whose cool reserve masks a dark and violent nature.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nUndone by the calamity of his parents' robbery and arrest, Dell struggles under the vast prairie sky to remake himself and define the adults he thought he knew. But his search for grace and peace only moves him nearer to a harrowing and murderous collision with Remlinger, an elemental force of darkness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA true masterwork of haunting and spectacular vision from one of our greatest writers, <i>Canada</i> is a profound novel of boundaries traversed, innocence lost and reconciled, and the mysterious and consoling bonds of family.

Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? How did the legalization of abortion affect the rate of violent crime?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThese may not sound like typical questions for an econo-mist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much-heralded scholar who studies the riddles of everyday life&#151;from cheating and crime to sports and child-rearing&#151;and whose conclusions turn conventional wisdom on its head. \n</p>\n\n<p>\n<i>Freakonomics</i> is a groundbreaking collaboration between Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, an award-winning author and journalist. They usually begin with a mountain of data and a simple question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThrough forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives&#151;how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In <i>Freakonomics</i>, they explore the hidden side of . . . well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Klu Klux Klan. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhat unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a great deal of complexity and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and&#151;if the right questions are asked&#151;is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. \n</p>\n\n<p>\n<i>Freakonomics</i> establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But <i>Freakonomics</i> can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBonus material added to the revised and expanded 2006 edition\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<p>\n</p><li>The original <i>New York Times Magazine</i> article about Steven D.

Levitt", "description": "Steven Levitt, uno dei pi\u00f9 geniali e giovani economisti americani, ha colto al volo un'occasione paradossale: usare la scienza per risolvere problemi che apparentemente non la riguardano. Scardinando i luoghi comuni e sconvolgendo il normale buon senso, l'autore mette in relazione fatti apparentemente lontanissimi fra loro dando risposte logiche ai paradossi del nostro tempo. Il fascino degli incentivi analizzato attraverso i numeri, la pena capitale come pessimo deterrente al crimine, la forza dell'informazione specie se distorta ad arte, cosa devono veramente fare i genitori per invogliare i figli alla lettura... La morale si limita a dire come il mondo dovrebbe andare, ma \u00e8 l'economia a dirci come va veramente. E da economista anticonformista, Levitt sottolinea come tutti possano mentire - lui compreso - ma i numeri proprio no. C'\u00e8 un perch\u00e9 inoppugnabile al fatto che la maggioranza degli spacciatori vive ancora a casa con la mamma, o che il nome di battesimo faccia la differenza nella vita. Levitt esplora con rigore e ironia il \"dietro le quinte\" della nostra societ\u00e0. Best-seller internazionale e vincitore di numerosi riconoscimenti, Freakoconomics \u00e8 una lettura divertente e straordinariamente intelligente che ci svela non solo il cosa, ma soprattutto il come e il perch\u00e9.

And the CEO would oblige, no questions asked, because it was his patriotic duty.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Freedom&rsquo;s Forge, </i>bestselling author Arthur Herman takes us back to that time, revealing how two extraordinary American businessmen&mdash;automobile magnate William Knudsen and shipbuilder Henry J. Kaiser&mdash;helped corral, cajole, and inspire business leaders across the country to mobilize the &ldquo;arsenal of democracy&rdquo; that propelled the Allies to victory in World War II.<br> &nbsp;<br> &ldquo;Knudsen? I want to see you in Washington. I want you to work on some production matters.&rdquo; With those words, President Franklin D. Roosevelt enlisted &ldquo;Big Bill&rdquo; Knudsen, a Danish immigrant who had risen through the ranks of the auto industry to become president of General Motors, to drop his plans for market domination and join the U.S. Army. Commissioned a lieutenant general, Knudsen assembled a crack team of industrial innovators, persuading them one by one to leave their lucrative private sector positions and join him in Washington, D.C. Dubbed the &ldquo;dollar-a-year men,&rdquo; these dedicated patriots quickly took charge of America&rsquo;s moribund war production effort. <br> &nbsp;<br> Henry J. Kaiser was a maverick California industrialist famed for his innovative business techniques and his can-do management style. He, too, joined the cause. His Liberty ships became World War II icons&mdash;and the Kaiser name became so admired that FDR briefly considered making him his vice president in 1944. Together, Knudsen and Kaiser created a wartime production behemoth. Drafting top talent from companies like Chrysler, Republic Steel, Boeing, Lockheed, GE, and Frigidaire, they turned auto plants into aircraft factories and civilian assembly lines into fountains of munitions, giving Americans fighting in Europe and Asia the tools they needed to defeat the Axis. In four short years they transformed America&rsquo;s army from a hollow shell into a truly global force, laying the foundations for a new industrial America&mdash;and for the country&rsquo;s rise as an economic as well as military superpower.<br> &nbsp;<br> Featuring behind-the-scenes portraits of FDR, George Marshall, Henry Stimson, Harry Hopkins, Jimmy Doolittle, and Curtis LeMay, as well as scores of largely forgotten heroes and heroines of the wartime industrial effort, <i>Freedom&rsquo;s Forge</i> is the American story writ large.

They did the job police simply couldn't. Lives were saved. Robberies were prevented. Homes were defended and left intact, all thanks to our constitutional right to keep and bear arms.  But despite the lessons of the L.A. riots, despite the fact that millions of Americans use firearms every year to prevent violent crime, and despite the clear intent of our Founding Fathers, there are those in America who believe you do not have the right to own a gun.  In \"Guns, Crime and Freedom,\" Wayne LaPierre tells the true story.  Until now, there has been no single source for Americans \u2014 gun owners and those who don't own guns but are still interested in the debate over gun control \u2014 to find the available facts surrounding the gun control argument. \"Guns, Crime and Freedom\" has all the facts. It explores the issues of gun control, crime, and the Second Amendment, and provides documented evidence and telling statements about the agenda of those who want to ban guns.  LaPierre vigorously challenges the media and their claim that private gun ownership is the cause of the spiraling crime rate that has made American streets and communities unsafe.

As we acquire the knack, meditation can be our companion wherever we are-at work, at play, at rest.<BR><BR>Meditation contains practical, step-by-step guides to a wide variety of meditation techniques selected by and/or created by Osho, including the unique OSHO Active Meditations which deal with the special tensions of contemporary life. Recognizing that it's almost impossible for most people these days just to stop and sit silently, these meditations - including the Osho Dynamic Meditation and Osho Kundalini Meditation - begin with one or more stages of vigorous physical activity. This brings our physical and mental energies to a peak, so that the following silence is easy -- leaving us alert, refreshed, and newly energized.<BR><BR>Newly revised, the perfect text to begin or continue exploring the joys of meditation.</DIV></DIV>", "trackName": "Meditation: The First and Last Freedom", "trackId": 381219608, "price": 4.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/3c/38/d7/mzi.zeeelbeo.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2010-09-28T10:04:44Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 371179205, "userRatingCount": 4, "averageUserRating": 4.0, "artworkUrl60": "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/3c/38/d7/mzi.zeeelbeo.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Meditation: The First and Last Freedom", "artistIds": ["list", 371179205, 2022753], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/meditation-first-last-freedom/id381219608?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Self-Improvement", "Books", "Health, Mind & Body"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/ajahn-munindo/id492487406?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "10106", "38", "9018"], "kind": "ebook", "artistName": "Ajahn Munindo", "description": "Sixteen transcribed talks given by Ajahn Munindo, mostly at Aruna Ratanagiri Monastery in Northumberland where he is resident abbot.", "trackName": "Unexpected Freedom", "trackId": 492565702, "price": 0.0, "artworkUrl100": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/9b/87/3d/mzi.pezvwakc.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2011-01-20T08:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 492487406, "userRatingCount": 1, "averageUserRating": 5.0, "artworkUrl60": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/9b/87/3d/mzi.pezvwakc.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Unexpected Freedom", "artistIds": ["list", 492487406], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/unexpected-freedom/id492565702?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Buddhism", "Books", "Religion & Spirituality"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/curtis-ackie/id515800598?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "9031", "38", "9020", "10044", "11001"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "First Clare, then Annabelle, followed by Bojana; the women in Eilian's life are swiftly abandoning him, and all in peculiar circumstances.

Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children&rsquo;s imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn&rsquo;t stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an &ldquo;excitement addict.&rdquo; Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. <P>Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town&#8212;and the family&#8212;Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents&rsquo; betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home. <P>What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms. <P>For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots.

Now, in <i>Girls Gone Mild</i>, the brilliantly outspoken author investigates an emerging new movement. Despite nearly-naked teen models posing seductively to sell us practically everything, and the proliferation of homemade sex tapes as star-making vehicles, a youth-led rebellion is already changing course.<br><br>In Seattle and Pittsburgh, teenage girls protest against companies that sell sleazy clothing. Online, a nineteen-year-old describes her struggles with her mother, who she feels is pressuring her to lose her virginity. In a small town outside Philadelphia, an eleventh-grade girl, upset over a &ldquo;dirty book&rdquo; read aloud in English class, takes her case to the school board. <br><br>These are not your mother&rsquo;s rebels.<br><br>In an age where pornography is mainstream, teen clothing seems stripper-patented, and &ldquo;experts&rdquo; recommend that we learn to be emotionally detached about sex, a key (and callously) targeted audience&ndash;girls&ndash;is fed up. <br>Drawing on numerous studies and interviews, Shalit makes the case that today&rsquo;s virulent &ldquo;bad girl&rdquo; mindset most truly oppresses young women. Nowadays, as even the youngest teenage girls feel the pressure to become cold sex sirens, put their bodies on public display, and suppress their feelings in order to feel accepted and (temporarily) loved, many young women are realizing that &ldquo;friends with benefits&rdquo; are often anything but. And as these girls speak for themselves, we see that what is expected of them turns out to be very different from what is in their own hearts.<br><br>Shalit reveals how the media, one&rsquo;s peers, and even parents can undermine girls&rsquo; quests for their authentic selves, details the problems of sex without intimacy, and explains what it means to break from the herd mentality and choose integrity over popularity. Written with sincerity and upbeat humor, <i>Girls Gone Mild</i> rescues the good girl from the realm of mythology and old manners guides to show that today&rsquo;s version is the real rebel: She is not &ldquo;people pleasing&rdquo; or repressed; she is simply reclaiming her individuality. These empowering stories are sure to be an inspiration to teenagers and parents alike.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>", "trackName": "Girls Gone Mild", "trackId": 422549820, "price": 14.99, "artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/wendy-shalit/id422549821?mt=11&uo=4", "artworkUrl100": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/0a/89/75/mzi.qbtklukz.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2007-06-26T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 422549821, "userRatingCount": 1, "averageUserRating": 5.0, "artworkUrl60": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/0a/89/75/mzi.qbtklukz.60x60-50.jpg", "artistIds": ["list", 422549821], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/girls-gone-mild/id422549820?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Parenting", "Books", "Health, Mind & Body", "Psychology", "Biographies & Memoirs"]}, {"trackCensoredName": "Bad Girl Gone Good", "genreIds": ["list", "10107", "38", "9018"], "kind": "ebook", "artistName": "Shirley P.

The play, set in Denmark, recounts how \nPrince Hamlet exacts revenge on his uncle Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet's \nfather, the King, and then taken the throne and married Hamlet's mother. The \nplay vividly charts the course of real and feigned madness\u2014from overwhelming \ngrief to seething rage\u2014and explores themes of treachery, revenge, incest, and \nmoral corruption.</p>\n<p>Despite much literary detective work, the exact year of writing remains in \ndispute. Three different early versions of the play have survived: these are \nknown as the First Quarto (Q1), the Second Quarto (Q2) and the First Folio (F1). \nEach has lines, and even scenes, that are missing from the others. Shakespeare \nprobably based <I>Hamlet</I> on the legend of Amleth, preserved by 13th-century \nchronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum and subsequently retold by \n16th-century scholar Fran\u00e7ois de Belleforest, and a supposedly lost Elizabethan \nplay known today as the <I>Ur-Hamlet</I>.</p>\n<p>Given the play's dramatic structure and depth of characterization, \n<I>Hamlet</I> can be analyzed, interpreted and argued about from many \nperspectives. For example, commentators have puzzled for centuries about \nHamlet's hesitation in killing his uncle. Some see it as a plot device to \nprolong the action, and others see it as the result of pressure exerted by the \ncomplex philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold-blooded murder, \ncalculated revenge and thwarted desire. More recently, psychoanalytic critics \nhave examined Hamlet's unconscious desires, and feminist critics have \nre-evaluated and rehabilitated the often maligned characters of Ophelia and \nGertrude.</p>\n<p><I>Hamlet</I> is Shakespeare's longest play, and among the most powerful and \ninfluential tragedies in the English language. It provides a storyline capable \nof \"seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others\". During his lifetime \nthe play was one of his most popular works, and it still ranks high among his \nmost-performed, topping, for example, the Royal Shakespeare Company's list since \n1879. It has inspired writers from Goethe and Dickens to Joyce and Murdoch, and \nhas been described as \"the world's most filmed story after <I>Cinderella</I>\". \nThe title role was almost certainly created for Richard Burbage, the leading \ntragedian of Shakespeare's time; in the four hundred years since, it has been \nplayed by the greatest actors, and sometimes actresses, of each successive \nage.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Excerpted from <i>Wikipedia, </i>the free encyclopedia.</p>", "trackName": "Hamlet", "trackId": 370192109, "price": 0.99, "artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/william-shakespeare/id2765976?mt=11&uo=4", "artworkUrl100": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/c6/87/96/mzi.juasjqrv.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2010-01-01T08:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 2765976, "userRatingCount": 12, "averageUserRating": 4.5, "artworkUrl60": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/c6/87/96/mzi.juasjqrv.60x60-50.jpg", "artistIds": ["list", 2765976], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/hamlet/id370192109?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Theater", "Books", "Arts & Entertainment"]}, {"trackCensoredName": "Hamlet", "genreIds": ["list", "10042", "38", "9031"], "kind": "ebook", "artistName": "William Shakespeare", "description": "There is arguably no work of fiction quoted as often as William Shakespeare's <I>Hamlet.</I> This haunting tragedy has touched audiences for centuries.

It has entertained audiences for centuries and the role of Hamlet is one of the most sought after by actors. It is the story of Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark who learns of the death of his father at the hands of his uncle, Claudius. Claudius murders Hamlet's father, his own brother, to take the throne of Denmark and to marry Hamlet's widowed mother. Hamlet is sunk into a state of great despair as a result of discovering the murder of his father and the infidelity of his mother. Hamlet is torn between his great sadness and his desire for the revenge of his father's murder. \"Hamlet\" is a work of great complexity and as such has drawn many different critical interpretations. Hamlet has been seen as a victim of circumstance, as an impractical idealist, as the sufferer of an Oedipus complex, as an opportunist wishing to kill his Uncle not for revenge but to ascend to the throne, as the sufferer of a great melancholy, and as a man blinded by his desire for revenge. The true motivations of Hamlet are complex and enigmatic and have been debated for centuries.

Drawing on some of history's most brilliant thinkers, from Plato to Shakespeare to Thoreau, he shows that digital connectedness serves us best when it's balanced by its opposite, <i>disconnectedness</i>. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nUsing his own life as laboratory and object lesson, Powers demonstrates why this is the moment to revisit our relationship to screens and mobile technologies, and how profound the rewards of doing so can be.

It won't be asking you questions like \"what school did Harry Potter go to?\" (If you are a Harry Potter fan, then of course you know the answer!) Rather it asks questions which will develop your literary appreciation of the Harry Potter books and your general knowledge of the Harry Potter phenomenon. Some of these questions are easy, quite a few are fiendishly difficult, and several of them really don't have simple answers, but thinking about possible answers is what it is all about.

Together, they present a careful case for upholding hell, showing that it remains central to a right understanding of God, the gospel, humanity, and God's purposes for the world.\n\nUseful for group discussion or individual study, Is Hell for Real or Does Everyone Go to Heaven? provides an accessible introduction to the historic Christian doctrine of hell.", "trackName": "Is Hell for Real or Does Everyone Go To Heaven?", "trackId": 441403135, "price": 8.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/8c/77/53/mzi.bvnzroto.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2011-07-25T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 449806098, "userRatingCount": 32, "averageUserRating": 2.5, "artworkUrl60": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/8c/77/53/mzi.bvnzroto.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Is Hell for Real or Does Everyone Go To Heaven?", "artistIds": ["list", 449806098], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/is-hell-for-real-or-does-everyone/id441403135?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Religion & Spirituality", "Books"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/bookrags.com/id464322651?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "10037", "38", "9029"], "kind": "ebook", "artistName": "BookRags.com", "description": "The Heaven Is for Real: A Little Boy's Astounding Story of His Trip to Heaven and Back Study Guide contains a comprehensive summary and analysis of Heaven Is for Real: A Little Boy's Astounding Story of His Trip to Heaven and Back by Todd Burpo.

Lee's surrender are devised to fulfill Lincoln's dream of healing a divided nation, with the former Confederates allowed to reintegrate into American society.

But inside thebuilding, changes had already taken place that would have broad implications for his agenda. The 111th Congress had convened on January 6 with a far stronger Democratic majority than the one that had preceded it. Their ambitious legislative agenda requires the assistance of their staffs to prepare them for all the important issues on the legislative table. Thus, it is more important than ever to know about senior congressional committee staff members and the role they play in shaping today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislation.While members of the House of Representatives and the Senate enact laws, it is often their staffers who exert the greatest influence in the lawmaking process. Staffers advise their elected bosses, establish political positions on issues, craft legislation, put policies in place, and play important roles on scores of congressional committees.

During this seminal period, revolutionaries destroyed the old regime, created a new national government, built an official political party, and then discarded in practice the essence of their revolution. In this tumultuous time, governors-some of whom later became president-served as the most significant intermediaries between the national government and the people it ruled.   Leading scholarsstudy governors from ten different states to demonstrate the diversity of the governors' experiences implementing individual revolutionary programs over time, as well as the waxing and waning of strong governorship as an institution that ultimately disappeared in the powerful national regime created in the 1940s and 1950s. Until that time, the contributors convincingly argue, the governors provided the revolution with invaluable versatility by dealing with pressing issues of land, labor, housing, and health at the local and regional levels. The flexibility of state governors also offered test cases for the implementation of national revolutionary laws and campaigns.

Recovering Uncle Tom requires re-telling his story. This book delivers on that mission, while accomplishing something no other work on Harriet Beecher Stowe has fully attempted: an in-depth statement of her political thought. Heroeuvre, in partnership with that of her husband Calvin, constitutes a demonstration of the permanent necessity of moraland prudential judgment in human affairs. Moreover, it identifies the political conditions that can best guarantee conditions of decency. Her two disciplines\u00e2\u20ac\u201cphilosophy and poetry\u00e2\u20ac\u201cilluminate the founding principles of the American republic and remedy defects in their realization that were evident in mid-nineteenth century. While slavery is not the only defect, its persistence and expansion indicate the overall shortcomings. In four of her chief works (Uncle Tom's Cabin,Sunny Memories of ForeignLands,Dred, andOldtown Folks), Stowe teaches not only how to eliminate the defect of slavery, but also how to realize and maintain a regime founded on the basis of natural rights and Christianity. Further, she identifies the proper vehiclefor educating citizens so they might reliably be ruled by decent public opinion.  Book one, part one of Rethinking Uncle Tom explains Uncle Tom's Cabin within the context of the Stowes' joint project, an articulation of the conditions of democratic life and the appropriate nature of modern humanism. Book two, parts one and two, analyses how key elements of Calvin's thinking were conveyed by Stowe's works, while distinguishing her thought from his, and examines the importance of her \"politicalgeography\" and the breadth of her thinking on cultural, moral, and political matters. Parts three and four investigate the most mature elements of Stowe's political thought, providing a close reading of Sunny Memories\u00e2\u20ac\u201crevealing the full political purpose of that work, discerned through mastery of its complex symbolism\u00e2\u20ac\u201cand of Oldtown Folks, which completes the development of Stowe's political thought by assessing three alternative regimes and by presenting a vision of anutopia: the ultima", "trackName": "Rethinking Uncle Tom", "trackId": 492174244, "price": 41.99, "artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/william-b.-allen/id492174246?mt=11&uo=4", "artworkUrl100": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/eb/09/fc/mzi.ikantxbd.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2009-03-16T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 492174246, "artistIds": ["list", 492174246], "artworkUrl60": "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/eb/09/fc/mzi.ikantxbd.60x60-50.jpg", "artistName": "William B.

They were all former students whom she had taught at university. Some came from conservative and religious families, others were progressive and secular; several had spent time in jail. They were shy and uncomfortable at first, unaccustomed to being asked to speak their minds, but soon they began to open up and to speak more freely, not only about the novels they were reading but also about themselves, their dreams and disappointments.

Neighbors while away afternoons at the local bar, swapping rumors about voodoo, incest, and illegitimate children. Usually they're gossiping about the Boten clan. <P> In this epic family saga, Lolita Files unveils the hidden lives of three generations of the Boten family. She introduces us to Grandma Amalie, a mother so fiercely protective, she will quietly sacrifice everything for her son. There's Grace, who conceals the identity of her child's father for more than twenty years. There's Aunt Sukie, whose strange power over her husband, Walter, is matched only by the strength of her dark magic. And then there's Lay, the bad seed, whose secret betrayals will cost his family dearly. <P> The family's past begins rising to the surface when a mysterious fire takes the life of young Ophelia Boten's infant son. The tragedy sets the family in motion, its members on a quest for self-discovery that will lead them to the drug world of inner-city Detroit, a midwestern college campus, the jungles of Vietnam, and back again. Ophelia sets her own course, one that will ultimately bring her into the arms of a caring and benevolent lover. But before she can embrace her new life and begin a family of her own, she must fully understand and accept the Boten clan's tormented legacy. <P> Inspired by Shakespeare's <I>Hamlet, Child of God</I> is a story of family bonds, of forbidden love, of sacrifice and redemption. Moving deftly forward and backward in time, the narrative weaves the past with the present, and the family's mistakes echo unforgettably through each successive generation.

Christian Australia felt Adrian Lyne's film of Lolita went too far - it violated God's Laws by validating and encouraging paedophilia.  The Christian Right gathered en masse to lobby the Australian Parliament to ban the film and in so doing place God's Law above freedom of speech: religious morality vs. human rights to freedom of information.  Did they succeed?  The case was one of the most hotly debated in Australian censorship history, polarizing the religious community and the civil libertarian / free speech movement in Australia, a country with no constitutional guarantee of free speech, unlike the USA.  Yet, the ringleader of the anti-censorship push and a protector of public morals and true Australian \"wowser\", was herself covertly embezzling taxpayer funds in a travel rort.  The case was to be the most influential in recent Aussie censorship law, ushering in a conservative creep that would make Australia categorically the most censorious of any so-called \"democracy\".  Featuring actual government documents and censor reports, Lolita vs. God's Law is an actual case history extracted and augmented for ebook from former National Film & Sound Archive SAR Research Fellow Robert Cettl's on-going research into Australia's secret film censorship history: in ebook, the secret censors are secret no more!", "trackName": "Lolita Vs.

Plaintiff filed no counter-affidavit, relying instead on her complaint, which contradicted both defendants answer and the affidavit accompanying his motion for summary judgment. The district court granted Harwards motion, apparently on the ground that no counter-affidavit had been filed. We hold that plaintiffs verified complaint, which controverted the facts set forth in Harwards affidavit, created a material issue of fact for resolution at trial.

Thus these narrations are the court record, from which there is no appeal, culminating in not only persuasive arguments about guilt and innocence of the central characters, but also demanding that a verdict or moral judgment be rendered by the reader of these behaviors and values of the individuals as well as the societies which these authors critique in their novels.", "trackName": "Trials and Verdicts: Narratives of Recollection in \"The Good Soldier\" and \"Lolita\".", "trackId": 511590025, "price": 39.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/fb/88/c7/fb88c7ca-8b0d-9c55-fbc1-4dc69829990f/9781124269092.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2012-03-17T08:11:10Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 511590117, "artistIds": ["list", 511590117], "artworkUrl60": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/fb/88/c7/fb88c7ca-8b0d-9c55-fbc1-4dc69829990f/9781124269092.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Trials and Verdicts: Narratives of Recollection in \"The Good Soldier\" and \"Lolita\".", "artistName": "Constance Elizabeth Holmes", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/trials-verdicts-narratives/id511590025?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Reference", "Books"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/wolfgang-wilhelm/id414207723?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "10082", "38", "9010"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "Neuauflage des Klassikers, Deutsch-T\u00fcrkisch!

The results of this study indicated a strong positive significant correlation between the six constructs of servant leadership and job satisfaction as measured by the Organization Leadership Assessment (OLA).

His work had been rejected by every major publisher&#8212;until an editor at Faber and Faber pulled his manuscript off the rejection pile. This was to become <I>Lord of the Flies, </I>a book that would sell in the millions and bring Golding worldwide recognition. <P>Golding went on to become one of the most popular and influential British authors to have emerged since World War II. He received the Booker Prize for the novel <I>Rites of Passage </I>in 1980, and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1983. Stephen King has stated that the Castle Rock in <I>Lord of the Flies </I>continues to inspire him, so much so that he named his entertainment company after it and has placed the Golding novel prominently in his novels <I>Hearts in Atlantis </I>and <I>Cujo</I>. Golding has been called a British Vonnegut&#8212;disheveled and darkly humorous, perverse when it would have been easier to be bitter, bitter when it would have been easier to be lazy, sometimes more disturbing than he is palatable and above all fascinating beyond measure. <P>Yet despite the fame and acclaim, the renowned author saw himself as a monster&#8212;a reclusive depressive ruled by his fears and a man who battled alcoholism throughout his life. In addition to being a schoolteacher, Golding was a scientist, a sailor and a poet before becoming a bestselling author, and his embitterment and alienation, his family, the women in his past, along with his experiences in the war, inform his work. This is the first book to unpack the life and character of a man whose entire <I>oeuvre </I>dealt with the conflict between light and dark in the human soul, tracing the defects of society back to the defects of human nature itself. <P><P>Drawing almost entirely on materials that have never before been made public, John Carey sheds new light on Golding. Through his exclusive access to Golding&#8217;s family, Carey uses hundreds of letters, unpublished works and Golding&#8217;s intimate journals to draw a revelatory and definitive portrait. An acclaimed critic, Carey enriches crucially our appreciation of the literary work of Golding, bringing us, as the best literary biographies do, back to the books. And with equal parts lyricism and driving emotion, Carey brings to light a life that is extraordinary to the point of transcendent and a writer who trusted the imagination above all things.", "trackName": "William Golding", "trackId": 381583271, "price": 21.99, "artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/john-carey/id358334101?mt=11&uo=4", "artworkUrl100": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/e9/1c/fb/mzi.lmdkfpkz.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2010-06-01T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 358334101, "userRatingCount": 2, "averageUserRating": 5.0, "artworkUrl60": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/e9/1c/fb/mzi.lmdkfpkz.60x60-50.jpg", "artistIds": ["list", 358334101], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/william-golding/id381583271?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Biographies & Memoirs", "Books", "History", "Europe", "Fiction & Literature", "Literary"]}, {"trackCensoredName": "Wilderness and Delinquents: Strategies for Avoiding a 'Lord of the Flies' Experience.", "genreIds": ["list", "10037", "38", "9029"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "Abstract Although much has been written about wilderness experiences and their ability to change attitudes and behaviour, very little has been said on the important role of the leader and the strategies used in diffusing problems and allowing positive learning to occur.

In casting about for another sort of suitable character his thoughts turned to Tom Bombadil, the hero of Tolkien's curious poem \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil.\" In mid-December 1937, he sent Unwin a copy of the poem and wrote to explain that the fun of hobbits was all used up and that he would have to pursue something different.    Tolkien soon found, however, that he did have a great deal more to say about hobbits after all. Still, he managed keep his original idea in play.

INTRODUCTION The Lord of the Rings, an epic fantasy fiction, was written by J. R. R. Tolkien, professor of philology and Anglo-Saxon language of Oxford University. The story takes place in an imaginary time and place, i.e. the Third Age of Middle-earth. The lands of Middle-earth are populated by Men and other humanoid races, as well as many fantastical creatures. Starting from quiet beginnings in the Shire, the trilogy ranges across Middle-earth and follows the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters, most notably the central protagonist Frodo Baggins. As a great linguist and writer, Tolkien created various languages for his fantastical creatures through which he showed the readers a marvelous world and successfully embedded the immense historical background. Since its publication, The Lord of the Rings has been reprinted numerous times and translated into more than 40 languages, exerting a great influence on modern fantasy literature.", "trackName": "Fantasy in Translation: A Study of Two Chinese Versions of the Lord of the Rings/ Fantasie Dans la Traduction: Une Etude Sur Les Deux Versions Chinoises Du Seigneur des Anneaux (Report)", "trackId": 512833800, "price": 5.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/fd/33/3a/fd333a9a-5401-460b-914b-87609fdfbdae/249137166.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2010-12-31T08:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 482368261, "artistIds": ["list", 482368261], "artworkUrl60": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/fd/33/3a/fd333a9a-5401-460b-914b-87609fdfbdae/249137166.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Fantasy in Translation: A Study of Two Chinese Versions of the Lord of the Rings/ Fantasie Dans la Traduction: Une Etude Sur Les Deux Versions Chinoises Du Seigneur des Anneaux (Report)", "artistName": "Cross-Cultural Communication", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/fantasy-in-translation-study/id512833800?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Social Science", "Books", "Nonfiction"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/herwig-schopper/id501905181?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "9019", "38", "10117"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "<P>Housed by a 4 m diameter tunnel of 27 km circumference, with huge underground labs and numerous surface facilities, and set up with a precision of 0.1 mm per kilometer, the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) was not only the largest but also one of the most sophisticated scientific research instrument ever created by Man.

He earned that degree, and the Bowling Green School of Music's award for Best Thesis of the Year, in 2007; he is now a doctoral candidate at the University of Texas at Austin. I said that his book began as a thesis, but I should perhaps add that it has also ended as one. Young has taken no opportunity to update or expand what is, after all, quite a short monograph. Moreover, apart from the difference in title pages, the book as published by VDM Verlag Dr. Muller is identical to the original master's thesis, right down to its typographical and grammatical errors, margins, fonts, layout, page numbers--and the peculiar and conspicuous omission of the definite article in the title.

Galadriel, the Elven queen of The Lord of the Rings (LotR), is suggestively powerful, yet at enough of a remove that the boundaries of her authority remain unclear. So is Morgan le Fey in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (SGGK), a tale Tolkien translated from Middle English. (I have provided a brief summary of the tale at the end of this article for those to whom it is unfamiliar.) In both cases a sense of enigma is generated by the silence surrounding the women's ability to influence events and characters. We are never sure how they do what they do. We are never entirely sure how much they do. Their magic, a feminine faerie force, is thus both sinister and beguiling, a provocative puzzle that lingers as an after-image once the spotlit heroes' actions have been fully registered. What is going on in the shadowy gaps of the texts? As much as heroes must shine, these women need textual absence to be effective. Morgan, a model whom I believe influences Galadriel's enigmatic agency, is a good example of a fictional character who works the gap. She functions as a feminine site that receives all that is threatening about the Green Knight once Gawain gets to know him better and to discover that he really is just kidding after all: the Green Knight's menace really was just a sharp-edged Christmas game. The Green Knight is revealed to Gawain as Bertilak the genial host. Morgan remains a stranger: as such, she can be blamed as agent so that the males can bond more effectively. Then we hear nothing more about her, although arguably that emblematic green girdle that Gawain takes home as a token is imprinted with her power.

R. R. Tolkien in The Lord of the Rings provides a detailed description of the war gear borne by each member of the Fellowship: (1)    Gimli's axe and Legolas's bow notwithstanding, the place of honor among the weapons carried by the Company is reserved for swords: swords with names, swords with lineages, swords with magical properties, and swords that herald (as Aragorn's does) the closing of the Third Age. Clearly, then, in Middle-earth as in medieval Europe, the sword possesses what its most distinguished modern commentator, Ewart Oakeshott, describes as \"a potent mystique which sets it above any other man-made object\" (1). Considering that Tolkien's professional life was spent immersed in Germanic, Norse, Celtic, and English medieval literature and mythology, including texts rich in swords and sword-lore, it is scarcely surprising that the characters in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are provided with weapons whose names, descriptions, acquisition, characteristics and lore echo those of what Tolkien called the \"northern mythological imagination\" (\"Monsters\" 268), or as one recent critic has put it, the \"real Middle-earth\" (Bates): Northwestern Europe in the early and central middle ages. This paper seeks to illuminate resonances of medieval swords and sword-lore in Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, where swords and the lore associated with them play important, if largely neglected, roles. (2) It will be argued that the blades of Middle-earth as presented in these works display the influence of famous literary, mythological, and historical weapons from northern Europe in the middle ages, highlighting Middle-earth's well-established inheritance of Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Norse and later medieval literature and mythology. Moreover, because of the association of specific weapons with particular heroes in this literature, such a study also bears on the nature of heroism in Tolkien's work.", "trackName": "\"in the Hilt Is Fame\": Resonances of Medieval Swords and Sword-Lore in J.R.R.

It is true that she only really plays an important role in the Lothlorien episode in Book II: 6-8, and at the very end of Book VI. Part of the problem is that the story of her past life in Middle-earth was never really told in The Lord of the Rings, but only hinted at in the \"Lament of Galadriel\" (LotR II.8). Tolkien himself obviously felt dissatisfied by his treatment of Galadriel after LotR was published, and elaborated on her history in several late writings, including post-LotR versions of The Silmarillion (Sil.), some of his late letters (Letters), the section on The History of Galadriel and Celeborn in the Unfinished Tales (UT), and some notes that Tolkien himself supplied to Donald Swann's Song Cycle The Road Goes Ever On, first published in 1967. In addition Volumes 6-9 and 12 of The History of Middle-earth (HME) also contain early drafts of LotR, which allow us to see more clearly the emergence of Galadriel into the narrative. In several of these late writings Tolkien elaborated a story of Galadriel's Fall and Repentance, only to repudiate it in the final year of his life. (2) Perhaps the most succinct statement of the later story of Galadriel's Fall and Repentance can be found in a letter to Mrs. Ruth Austin in 25th Jan. 1971, written only two years before Tolkien's death:", "trackName": "The Fall and Repentance of Galadriel (\"the Lord of the Rings\" Character)", "trackId": 514377934, "price": 5.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/4d/fe/b3/4dfeb391-c6ef-d543-462d-fd561b558dad/163972506.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2007-03-22T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 482945224, "artistIds": ["list", 482945224], "artworkUrl60": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/4d/fe/b3/4dfeb391-c6ef-d543-462d-fd561b558dad/163972506.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "The Fall and Repentance of Galadriel (\"the Lord of the Rings\" Character)", "artistName": "Mythlore", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/fall-repentance-galadriel/id514377934?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Language Arts & Disciplines", "Books", "Professional & Technical", "Education"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/mythlore/id482945224?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "11009", "38", "9029", "10037"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "IN the essay, \"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics,\" J.R.R. Tolkien contends with early critics who debunk the poem's poetic and structural artistry: \"[T]he monsters are not an inexplicable blunder of taste; they are essential, fundamentally allied to the underlying ideas of the poem\" (19). Because of Tolkien's insistence on the significance of the monsters in Beowulf, the study of monsters in Tolkien's own work is without question an essential task for scholars seeking to discover meaning in his narratives. The conception of many of his own monsters reveals an underlying classical Christian doctrine that declares that evil is not created as an autonomous force; rather, it is only the perversion of good. Therefore, evil functions as a kind of parasite, corrupting the pure for its own dark purposes. As Frodo reminds Sam, \"the Shadow [...] can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own\" (The Lord of the Rings [LotR] 893). Some monsters of Middle-earth seek to guard the passages that allow the progress of the good, some seek to feed on the good to satisfy their dark lusts, and some seek to possess the good in order to corrupt it to their own evil wills. Interestingly, Tolkien empowers many of his monsters with the weapon of vision as they struggle to achieve these ends. Through a close study of three of the monsters in The Lord of the Rings, The Watcher in the Water, Shelob, and Sauron, the reader can discern a distinct, objective characterization of evil as a 'watcher' which seeks to control its victims through the power of the visual gaze. This concept can then be taken a step further to examine the relationship of audience to text in Peter Jackson's film adaptation. Unlike the reader, the audience as viewer can be seen as inherently resembling this distinct, objective characterization of evil 'watcher.' Middle-earth is perceived through the lens of the camera that characteristically behaves like an 'evil eye.' Through an examination of the function of the camera in the adaptation of the text from a written to a visual medium, one can see how Jackson's audience is cast in a role like that of Tolkien's monsters, seeking to control and dominate through the means of the visual image.

These universal heroes, under many different guises and many different names, all undertake a similar journey regardless of the time or place in which they appear. The protagonist begins at home in what may be described as an immature state, goes on some kind of quest, and in the final stage comes home changed. This journey involves a departure from a safe and familiar place, initiation into a larger unknown world where there are trials and testing, some form of death and rebirth, and then finally return and reinvigoration. Campbell argues that this story of the hero with a thousand faces is essential to a culture because it contains the fundamental truths about the growth and maturation that each individual must undergo. He points out that in all of these stories, the hero goes on a quest to save the kingdom, and in doing so he also saves himself (Campbell, Power 149).    In The Hobbit, Bilbo's external quest is to help the dwarves regain their treasure, and in the process--by saying yes to the adventure--he also saves himself from a life which up until then has largely been bounded by a concern for his own safety and comfort in his snug little hobbit-hole. So what could we say is Frodo's personal quest in The Lord of the Rings?

Noble, cold, and stern, she desires to find death, not to renew life; she searches for glory, not healing. Yet, amid the carnage and hopelessness of combat in The Return of the King, J.R.R. Tolkien develops a courtship centered on Eowyn, one that is ultimately imbued with the same wartime ethos that surrounded the young women of World Wars I and II. (1) Eowyn, shield-maiden of the Rohirrim, and Faramir, a former captain newly succeeded to the title of Steward of Gondor, figure principally in what is popularly termed a \"wartime romance\"--a relationship characterized by an accelerated intimacy attributed to the pressures and fears of war, including the uncertainty of prolonged separation and death. As Tolkien constructs it, however, Eowyn's attachments are not so simplistically binary: Aragorn, son of Arathorn, has also attracted her affections, creating a system that actually allows for a comprehensive representation of the several incarnations of the World Wars' \"war brides.\" Eowyn's respective relationships with Aragorn and Faramir thus cast her in the dual roles of war bride-left-behind and foreign war bride, and while comparison of her experiences with the courtship, marriage, and assimilation experiences of women in the war-torn twentieth century reveal her to be a negative example of the former, she is clearly, for Tolkien, a positive exemplar of the latter. Though not usually pinpointed as a social issue in past periods of international warfare, the principles that lie behind the concept of the \"war bride\" make it a timeless and world-encompassing phenomenon--perhaps every bit as old as the span of human history. (2) Yet the term \"war bride\" is itself a relatively new one, seeming to rise into prominence in the social and cultural upheavals of the First World War that Tolkien experienced so intimately. Indeed, the first citation of the term's use in the Oxford English Dictionary--a project that famously provided Tolkien with his first post-war job (3) (researching for the W's, no less [Gilliver, Marshall &#38; Weiner 7])--is dated 1918, the year the Great War ended (\"War\"). OED aside, the term appears often in the literature and even in the pop culture of the time. Writing during the First World War, for example, a woman named Ruth Wolfe Fuller, whose husband was drafted into the United States army two months after their marriage, subtitled her brief reminiscences, \"The Experiences of a War Bride.\" Even earlier, in September of 1914, a short play entitled \"War Brides\" was written by Marion Craig Wentworth and was staged for the first time in January of 1915 (Wentworth 6). Detailing the choices of women in a war-torn country, Wentworth's drama enjoyed some notable success in the climate of the times. Little different is the climate of the Second World War; the term \"war bride\" surfaced repeatedly in the media, in movies like I Was a Male War Bride (1949), starring Cary Grant, and in popular radio shows, like \"Fibber McGee and Molly.\" In one episode of \"Fibber McGee,\" aired on 3 March 1941, Fibber receives a letter informing him that he is to report for induction into the army, as he has been drafted into the Armed Services. Although the letter turns out to be a copy of his original World War One draft notice, Fibber is convinced throughout the episode of the letter's contemporary authenticity. Upon hearing of her husband's seeming re-call into the army, his wife Molly cries, \"Imagine me! A war bride! Again!\" Molly's dismay at the prospect of a repetition of her experiences confirms that the previous war had produced a social figure that was being recognizably reproduced in 1941. War brides from Molly's generation even saw enough common experience between themselves and the new brides to introduce themselves", "trackName": "At Home and Abroad: Eowyn's Two-Fold Figuring As war Bride in the Lord of the Rings.", "trackId": 512554635, "price": 5.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/fe/75/03/fe75030b-ff67-998b-8e50-9146abe1b921/171579965.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2007-09-22T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 482945224, "artistIds": ["list", 482945224], "artworkUrl60": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/fe/75/03/fe75030b-ff67-998b-8e50-9146abe1b921/171579965.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "At Home and Abroad: Eowyn's Two-Fold Figuring As war Bride in the Lord of the Rings.", "artistName": "Mythlore", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/at-home-abroad-eowyns-two/id512554635?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Language Arts & Disciplines", "Books", "Professional & Technical", "Education"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/mythlore/id482945224?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "11009", "38", "9029", "10037"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "IF ONE CONSIDERS THE TERM \"ARTIFACT\" in relation to the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien, several thoughts spring to mind. First and foremost is the way in which his work has been regarded as cultural artifact, born out of his generation's experience in World War One, but so wildly received by subsequent generations that its popularity informs, either for or against his work, in scholarly opinions of his novels. It is also an artifact of both the medieval and the modern world. The frame story conceit of The Lord of the Rings, that Tolkien is not a novelist but a translator, and the story we read is in fact \"Frodo and the One Ring\" found in the fictitious Red Book of Westmarch (The Lord of the Rings [LotR] Prologue 1) is an echo of the medievalist practice of classifying certain works by color. The academic presentation of the novel, with its publisher's note on the text, forward, lengthy appendices and multiple indexes, arrays the symbols of scholarship and the early medieval period in the intellect and imagination in order to further acceptance of the fantastic elements that are necessary to both understanding and enjoying the narrative. In order to further discuss the way in which artifacts function as symbols, I will explore the way in which one particular marker of medievalism, the sword, serves to reinforce the themes of The Lord of the Rings.    Tolkien's novel is filled with wondrous and magical items. They range from the innocuous--magical ropes and bread--through to the important, such as Frodo's mithril shirt, and on to the definitive in the One Ring. Each contributes to the symbolic construction of Middle-earth, but prior scholarship on Tolkien's artifacts has, understandably, been focused almost exclusively on the One Ring. Prior work on source texts has led to excellent connections being drawn between the One Ring and Plato's Ring of Gyges in The Republic (Cox) and various works of medieval literature, including the Norse Sagas and the Nibelungenlied (Shippey, The Road to Middle-earth). There are very few scholars who have taken issue with the Ring's metaphor of addiction, power and corruption. As Tom Shippey has said, the Ring is \"far too plausible, and too recognizable\" for a Twentieth Century audience to easily dismiss (J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century 115).", "trackName": "The Blade Against the Burden: The Iconograpgy of the Sword in the Lord of the Rings (Critical Essay)", "trackId": 521183309, "price": 5.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/b6/f4/16/b6f41699-32f7-c7e9-0754-66aab8d334d6/188065415.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2008-09-22T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 482945224, "artistIds": ["list", 482945224], "artworkUrl60": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/b6/f4/16/b6f41699-32f7-c7e9-0754-66aab8d334d6/188065415.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "The Blade Against the Burden: The Iconograpgy of the Sword in the Lord of the Rings (Critical Essay)", "artistName": "Mythlore", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/blade-against-burden-iconograpgy/id521183309?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Language Arts & Disciplines", "Books", "Professional & Technical", "Education"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/mythlore/id482945224?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "11009", "38", "9029", "10037"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "For all its earlier medieval origins, serving--particularly in France--the needs of an essentially courtly and aristocratic society, Arthurian literature has far outlived that society.

Tolkien gives the 20th century a fantasy epic of medieval proportions. It is a story of the littlest person, a hobbit, overcoming the tides of war. In his trilogy, Tolkien fashions a narrative that forcefully asserts the idea that wars should only be fought to protect and preserve, not to conquer and destroy. While a number of critics have accused Tolkien of subsuming his female characters in a sea of powerful men, one heroine, Eowyn, the White Lady of Rohan, is given a full character arc in the novel. After being rejected by Lord Aragorn, Eowyn searches for meaning in life, choosing to follow her brother, Eomer, to fight in the War of the Ring. The White Lady of Rohan chooses as her fate to die in battle with glory and honor. However, after being wounded by a Ringwraith and restored in the courts of healing, she decides to give up life as a warrior and become a healer. Modern scholars have seen this as a choice to accept conventional female submissiveness. However, in choosing the path of protecting and preserving the earth, Eowyn acts in accordance with Tolkien's highest ideal: a fierce commitment to peace. Rather than submission, Eowyn embodies the full-blooded subjectivity that Tolkien posits as essential for peace. While other characters--most notably Sam--also embody this ideal, it is Eowyn who most successfully fulfills the role. In making this argument, I hope to show how modern criticism has misread the role of women in Tolkien's epic, and has thus overlooked much of the importance of his vast and compelling work.    Many modern scholars discount this fantasy epic not only because of its genre, but for its mass-market appeal and its seeming lack of depth. Feminist critics, however, have been even harsher in their dealings with Tolkien. While a professor at Oxford, J.R.R. Tolkien formed a male literary club. The Inklings, including C.S. Lewis and Charles Williams, were the first audience to hear The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. This male-dominated institution inspired Candice Fredrick and Sam McBride in Women Among the Inklings to pose the idea that \"Middle-earth is very Inkling-like, in that while women exist in the world, they need not be given significant attention and can, if one is lucky, simply be avoided altogether\" (108). Tolkien's world of men seems, to most, very chivalric in its philosophy of leaving women behind, and some female readers feel abandoned by Tolkien's lack of women characters. There are only three significant ones: Galadriel, Arwen, and Eowyn. Hobbit women are mentioned, but only as housewives or shrews, like Rosie Cotton or Lobelia Sackville-Baggins. Tom Bombadil's wife Goldberry is a mystical washer-woman. Dwarf women are androgynous, while the Ents have lost their wives. When discussing male and female characters, it is important to note that only the real humans achieve emotional fullness, and the mythic individuals attain only romanticized futures.", "trackName": "Finding Woman's Role in the Lord of the Rings (Character Overview)", "trackId": 516987641, "price": 5.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/a4/60/c2/a460c2b0-7412-0091-151b-70b84a3a8638/163972502.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2007-03-22T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 482945224, "artistIds": ["list", 482945224], "artworkUrl60": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/a4/60/c2/a460c2b0-7412-0091-151b-70b84a3a8638/163972502.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Finding Woman's Role in the Lord of the Rings (Character Overview)", "artistName": "Mythlore", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/finding-womans-role-in-lord/id516987641?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Language Arts & Disciplines", "Books", "Professional & Technical", "Education"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/howard-shore/id2898817?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "10087", "38", "9007"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "Music from all three films arranged for string instruments.

Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings was rewritten as a film script by Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens and the film itself released in three parts that more or less coincide with the volume divisions of the original text: The Fellowship of the Ring ([FR] 2001), The Two Towers ([TT] 2002), and The Return of the King ([RK] 2003). (1) In the film, as in the text, interlace is used to amplify and expand upon the central \"matter\" of the narrative in a manner that dramatizes its status as myth. (2) This paper identifies the specifically filmic variations of Tolkien's interlace involving cross-cutting apparent in the extended DVD editions of the trilogy: the appendix is a list of the occasions of interlace and the paper itself is a discussion of how the interlace technique is applied in the development of particular aspects of the lives of Isildur, Gollum, and Elrond in the film relative to the text.    All of the three types of narrative interlace found in Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings [LotR, to distinguish it from the movies] also characterize Alan Lee's illustrations for that text (Auger 2008). These types include structural interlace, which involves achronological order, such that events are placed out of natural time so as to enhance and draw out associations--similarities and dissimilarities--between characters, events, and themes; stylistic interlace, which refers to the repetition or restatement of a particular theme or other element as a way of both emphasizing it and exploring its potential implications; (3) and pictorial interlace, which refers to the manner in which the movements of characters and the obstacles and furtherances they encounter are imbricated with the environment itself such that all are \"apprehended like an image\" (Fein 232), or as if the environment itself were a projection of the inner state and will of the characters (Burlin). In both Tolkien's text and Lee's illustrations, structural interlace is frequently apparent in the moments dedicated to story, dream, and fortune-telling because they intertwine past, present, and probable future events; stylistic interlace appears in the frequent restating of such themes as love and loyalty, and kingship and stewardship; and pictorial interlace appears so continuously that the physical aspects of the environment appear as a direct manifestation of the motivations and will of the various characters with regard to the quest.", "trackName": "The Lord of the Rings' Interlace: The Adaptation to Film (Critical Essay)", "trackId": 516717426, "price": 5.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/ab/28/9f/ab289f0d-25a9-bfbf-30f6-ee87cd0a7381/272364404.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2011-09-22T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 482945224, "artistIds": ["list", 482945224], "artworkUrl60": "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/ab/28/9f/ab289f0d-25a9-bfbf-30f6-ee87cd0a7381/272364404.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "The Lord of the Rings' Interlace: The Adaptation to Film (Critical Essay)", "artistName": "Mythlore", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/lord-rings-interlace-adaptation/id516717426?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Language Arts & Disciplines", "Books", "Professional & Technical", "Education"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/mythlore/id482945224?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "11009", "38", "9029", "10037"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "THE social structure of Middle-earth, in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, is clearly based on medieval historical models. The style of governance and the societal landscape of Rohan and Minas Tirith are modeled on the individual, divided kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England that were united in the later Middle Ages under one king. According to Marc Bloch's socially based definition of feudalism in Feudal Society, the king ruled over all the people of his kingdom, including the various levels of aristocrats. The highest ranked dukes and earls in turn governed fiefs or land holdings and the vassals that dwelt there, including lower ranked aristocrats, barons and knights, as well as the commoners--serfs and peasants. The higher ranked lords conferred smaller fiefs to the barons and knights beneath them who dwelt within their borders. The lords at each level were responsible for distributing the land and its revenues and protecting their people in exchange for their service and loyalty. In reciprocity, the lower level aristocrats, serfs, and peasants pledged their fealty and service--military, domestic, or field/manual labor--depending on rank and ability, to the lords at ranks higher than their own. Tolkien has carefully explicated the role of lord and leader in this society, positively through Theoden and negatively through his foil Denethor, and culminating in the ascension of Aragorn to the throne, thereby reenacting the medieval unification of smaller realms ruled by lords under one absolute sovereign. Interestingly, Tolkien chooses to portray the change of guard from elves to men not as to a more modernized society with a parliamentary governing structure as found in Victorian England or later but to a tiered society united under one king as existed in the High Middle Ages. In fact, Saruman, with his wicked machines and newly bred orcs, actually represents a warning against the potential danger and destruction that come with the dawn of the Industrial Age and which are realized in the war and ruin of the twentieth century. The reclusive Hobbits, who must join the other races of the world, are much like the reclusive Victorians who could afford such insularism due to the political and economic stability at home during the nineteenth century, only decades before England would have to join with its allies to fight in both World Wars. While history tends to concentrate on the rulers and leaders who rose and fell as society evolved, Tolkien's imaginative vision highlights the importance of the role of the vassal, the loyal follower, the everyman of medieval society, who defines himself in relation to his fellows and to his lord.", "trackName": "Feudal Values, Vassalage, And Fealty in the Lord of the Rings.", "trackId": 514377930, "price": 5.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/b6/02/da/b602daba-a891-a588-6e49-185f4876381a/163972500.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2007-03-22T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 482945224, "artistIds": ["list", 482945224], "artworkUrl60": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/b6/02/da/b602daba-a891-a588-6e49-185f4876381a/163972500.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Feudal Values, Vassalage, And Fealty in the Lord of the Rings.", "artistName": "Mythlore", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/feudal-values-vassalage-fealty/id514377930?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Language Arts & Disciplines", "Books", "Professional & Technical", "Education"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/mythlore/id482945224?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "11009", "38", "9029", "10037"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "THE RING AND THE CROSS: CHRISTIANITY AND THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Edited by Paul E. Kerry. Madison: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2011. 310pp. ISBN 9781611470642. $80.00.    The Ring and The Cross is a collection of fifteen papers--plus a dense historiographical introduction--dedicated to exploring and debating the Roman Catholicism of J.R.R. Tolkien, and most especially its place in the analysis of his fantasy writings. It should be noted that the subtitle of the book's cover and that of its cover page differ; the former gives Christianity and \"The Lord of the Rings,\" while the interior has Christianity and the Writings of J.R.R. Tolkien. The latter affords the more accurate scope, as the essays involve a range of works from Tolkien's legendarium. Details from his critical and personal writings are also brought in, as well as a great deal of biographical information. The purpose of the collection--perhaps a little misrepresented by the categorical air of its title--is described by editor and contributor Paul E. Kerry as \"a personal effort to bring together opposing views\" (7). The Ring and the Cross by no means purports to offer a definitive or exhaustive examination of its topic, something that might easily fill several volumes and fall short even so; as Kerry writes, \"[t]his collection is not designed to close off discussion and debate, but rather is an effort to show how lively, engaging, and productive the question of Christian influence on Tolkien's literary works remains\" (46).

Along with his faithful servant Sam, Frodo travels literally to the other side of his world of Middle-earth; for much of the journey the two hobbits travel alone, isolated from their companions. It is this isolation and psychological distance, even more than the physical distance, that separate Frodo from all that is safe and known and ultimately take a toll on his self confidence and emotional strength.    Devin Brown, in a 2006 article in Mythlore, explored Frodo's consistent preference for seclusion, citing his quest in the text as one of moving \"from isolation to community\" (Brown 163). Following this focus, Frodo's sense of isolation as he loses all of his fellow travelers except for the faithful Sam is selfimposed: a character trait about which Frodo is warned by Gandalf and others. According to Brown, \"if Frodo is to grow from his condition of isolation to the more mature condition of community, he will have to give up the Ring and his pattern of seclusion\" (166). Inevitably, this type of personal quest remains incomplete; although Frodo does manage to destroy the perilous One Ring, he remains an introvert who prefers few friends and quiet times.", "trackName": "So Far from the Shire: Psychological Distance and Isolation in the Lord of the Rings (Critical Essay)", "trackId": 521183040, "price": 5.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/fa/f4/9b/faf49b6f-5c1d-522c-812c-0c24ab8817ba/188065414.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2008-09-22T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 482945224, "artistIds": ["list", 482945224], "artworkUrl60": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/fa/f4/9b/faf49b6f-5c1d-522c-812c-0c24ab8817ba/188065414.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "So Far from the Shire: Psychological Distance and Isolation in the Lord of the Rings (Critical Essay)", "artistName": "Mythlore", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/so-far-from-shire-psychological/id521183040?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Language Arts & Disciplines", "Books", "Professional & Technical", "Education"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/mythlore/id482945224?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "11009", "38", "9029", "10037"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "THERE is no doubt that Peter Jackson makes excellent horror films. Linda Badley says in Film, Horror, and the Body Fantastic, \"Jackson is one of several talented young directors who found in splatter and grotesque fantasy the elements of a distinctive expressionistic style\" (156). Since he is primarily known as a horror director, it is interesting that he chose to adapt J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings to the screen. Jackson's splatter movie background does not blend well with Tolkien's fantasy ... or does it? When we look at Jackson's Lord of the Rings as a horror movie, as opposed to a fantasy film, we realize it is his grotesque horror we delight in, instead of ethereal fantasy.    Certain rules or cliches characterize the horror film. While many of these elements exist in Tolkien's fiction, Jackson focuses on the traits that mark his Lord of the Rings as horror in the explicit detail of his camera work--for example, the close-ups Jackson uses for the slimy birth of an Uruk-hai or the loving way his camera strokes Gollum's emaciated body.

Over the past half century, children everywhere have escaped into this world and delighted in its wonders and enchantments. Yet what we do know of the man who created Narnia? This biography sheds new light on the making of the original Narnian, C. S. Lewis himself.</p>\n\n<p>Lewis was one of the intellectual giants of the twentieth century and arguably the most influential religious writer of his day. An Oxford don and scholar of medieval literature, he loved to debate philosophy at his local pub, and his wartime broadcasts on the basics of Christian belief made him a celebrity in his native Britain. Yet one of the most intriguing aspects of Clive Staples Lewis remains a mystery. How did this middle-aged Irish bachelor turn to the writing of stories for children -- stories that would become among the most popular and beloved ever written?</p>\n\n<p>Alan Jacobs masterfully tells the story of the original Narnian. From Lewis's childhood days in Ireland playing with his brother, Warnie, to his horrific experiences in the trenches during World War I, to his friendship with J. R. R. Tolkien (and other members of the \"Inklings\"), and his remarkable late-life marriage to Joy Davidman, Jacobs traces the events and people that shaped Lewis's philosophy, theology, and fiction. The result is much more than a conventional biography of Lewis: Jacobs tells the story of a profound and extraordinary imagination.

Lewis can be a difficult man to understand. It is not, of course, that Lewis is not clear on the subject when he speaks of it. On the contrary, when he does it is generally with the same incisive clarity that he applies to all other subjects. The trouble is that Lewis simply does not say much about it at all. While other famous veterans of the First World War speak at great length and in horrible detail of what they saw and did, Lewis says what little he must and no more. Some newer authors, such as K.J. Gilchrist in his book A Morning After War: C.S. Lewis and WWI, argue that in Lewis's general attitude lurks the monster of some undiscovered trauma that caused him to willfully \"obscure facts\" about his wartime past (Gilchrist 1). Others, such as Humphrey Carpenter, talk about Lewis's \"silence\" on his wartime service but believe that it is because the war did not affect him as much as it could have (qtd. in Gilchrist 8).    When viewed from the perspective of the present author, an historian who has already published a work on a soldier who left relatively few records behind (Sherman's Forgotten General: Henry W. Slocum), Lewis does not seem to be abnormally reticent. After all, he was not a significant figure in the war and did not define himself by his time in it, as other writers did. If he appears to be suspiciously quiet, it may be due to the fact that he speaks so prolifically on other subjects that his discussions on war seem slim by comparison. In reality, he addresses it often enough and to a depth that is appropriate for the context in which the various discussions occur. Lewis may not have expended much of his energy looking at his time in the trenches, but he gives everyone enough to get on with. His devotees--the present included--may wish he had said more, but, then again, they generally wish he had said more about every subject he addressed and something about quite a few he did not.", "trackName": "The Great War and Narnia: C.S.

Lewis read part of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, still in manuscript, to J.R.R. Tolkien. Expecting enthusiasm from his longtime friend and colleague, he received instead what would remain Tolkien's permanent dismissal of the work. The assessment was blunt and unequivocal: Tolkien deemed the book almost worthless--a carelessly written jumble of unrelated mythologies. He simply detested it (Sayer 312, 313). Although shaken by this terse and unexpected verdict, Lewis later sought the opinion of Roger Lancelyn Green, whose encouragement lead to the ultimate decision to finish the book (Green &#38; Hooper, 241). It went on to become one of Lewis's best sellers. The first of what eventually became The Chronicles of Narnia, it has been continuously in print ever since. Now half a century from its first publication, the place of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe seems increasingly remarkable. Like The Lord of the Rings it remains embraced and even celebrated by a society steadily annexed by secular values. Its success both in book sales and, more recently, at the box office have even resulted in the somewhat bizarre spectacle of secular critics writing polemical tracts attempting to marginalize, if not deny, the Christian elements of the plot. (1) Thus Narnia's success has remained somewhat oddly stunning--the greatest testimony to its place in literature being this steady endurance in the public imagination, despite the societal shifts since its first publication. It can therefore seem, at least superficially, that Tolkien's opinion was not simply wrong, but ridiculously wrong. If ever there was any problem with Narnia, the sales history of the work would indicate that it was entirely Tolkien's. This, in fact, has functioned as the underlying assumption of much subsequent scholarly opinion. Moreover, the crisis of 1949 (2) has been identified as a contributing factor to the waning of the two men's friendship, with Tolkien considered primarily to blame. Professional jealousy, artistic narrowness, and even personal complexity as a man are supposed to have conspired against his appreciation of Narnia. He has been portrayed as envious of Lewis's writing speed, annoyed by his popular success, and offended by Lewis's appropriation of his own ideas and mythic histories. Finally, it has been suggested that there was a disagreement regarding the nature and rigors of mythopoeic writing between the two-that Tolkien slaved over every detail of a long gestating masterwork, while Lewis churned out commercially successful books which might have been deemed less scrupulous in craft (Carpenter, Tolkien 201; Sayer 313). Yet despite some compelling aspects of these theories, they seem unconvincing when considered in the broader context of their friendship and careers.", "trackName": "Letters to Malcolm and the Trouble with Narnia: C.S.

S. LEWIS'S THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA (1950-1956) are remembered by many adults as favorite books from their childhood. The excitement of finding a hidden world in a wardrobe, the possibility of being a king or queen in a fantasyland, the existence of fauns, dryads, and unicorns--all of these create a sense of magic and wonder that is nearly impossible to resist. The recent successes of the movie adaptations of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) and Prince Caspian (2008) show that these stories continue to appeal to readers and viewers today. When the Chronicles are read with a more critical eye, however, the reader will notice a marked lack of sexuality and treatment of sexual desire in all the stories, particularly when compared with some of Lewis's other writings such as Perelandra, The Pilgrim's Regress, and Surprised by Joy. Although this lack of sexuality and erotic love is consistent with Lewis's desire to create a world of innocence for children, it is also problematic in that it allows others to write the themes of sexuality and desire into the story in ways that Lewis cannot control. One of the most obvious ways this happens is through Lewis's use of characters and imagery from other authors, most notably Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Snow Queen.\" These outside influences not only bring sexuality into Lewis's narratives, but the desire they portray takes on several non-traditional forms as well, including desire by a boy for an older woman. Even for those who are not familiar with stories such as \"The Snow Queen,\" the language that Lewis uses to talk about joy and desire, as well as his inclusion of familiar mythological creatures such as satyrs and incubuses, introduces the possibility of deviant sexuality into his world of innocence. Recent movie adaptations of Lewis's Chronicles, as well as works by contemporary fantasy authors Philip Pullman and Neil Gaiman, further compound the question of sexuality introduced by such imagery, revising the image of Narnia or writing other fantasy worlds as places in which sexuality, sometimes joyful, but sometimes unnatural and disturbing, can exist. All of these images--both those used by Lewis as well as those created by others--work together to bring sexuality and desire into The Chronicles of Narnia, calling into question the innocent world that Lewis worked hard to create and valued so highly.    From the very beginning of C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia, the major relationships between males and females are defined by friendship or by family, rather than through sexual desire. The most obvious example of this is the four Pevensie children from The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, who are all siblings. As Shasta realizes in The Horse and His Boy [HHB], \"Although they're king and queen, they're brother and sister, not married to one another\" (61). Significantly, however, this is not the only male/female relationship in Lewis' Chronicles that is defined through friendship or familial ties; these ties are the rule, rather than the exception. Polly and Digory in The Magician's Nephew are neighbors, not brother and sister, but there is no sexual relationship between them: \"Polly and Digory were always great friends and she came nearly every holiday to stay with them at their beautiful house in the country\" (184). Similarly, Jill and Eustace in The Silver Chair and The Last Battle are classmates, but not sexually linked: they \"were always good friends\" (Silver Chair 216). Therefore, while all of the pairings of children visiting Narnia include both a boy and a girl, these relationships are either familial or amiable--never sexual.", "trackName": "No Sex in Narnia?

The movie brought into our writing classrooms a renewed interest not only in the children's novel on which the screenplay is based, but in the entire spectrum of literature by C.S. Lewis, one of the 20th century's most lucid Christian apologists--a collective excitement comparable to the rekindled passion for J.R.R. Tolkien that accompanied the Lord of the Rings films. More than that, however, it gave us faculty members a legitimate excuse to revisit the fantasy world of Narnia, most for the first time since childhood. As college writing professors, we looked to the book for ways to harness newfound student energy in the classroom. But as creative writers ourselves, our second tour of Narnia, more critical and methodical this time around, proved even more fruitful. The book version of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (LWW), first published in 1950, could be viewed as the product of a group that nearly every contemporary fiction writer is intimately familiar with: the writing workshop, in this case the informal writers' group known as the Inklings. As participants in numerous creative writing workshops ourselves, we have been conditioned to read literature from that particular perspective--not as passive subjects or strictly analytical critics, but as fellow craftsmen.

His friends, the dwarfs Trumpkin and Nikabrik, greet Trufflehunter's assertion skeptically; and despite our recognition that writers create conventions to govern their fantasy worlds, we readers likewise may wonder why this animal land needs a human ruler. It is easy, like Trumpkin, to see this imperative as unnecessary or even, like Nikabrik, as unfair. Yet this Narnian \"rule\" is not merely a hook to engage child-readers or a quaint plot device to justify human visitors from our world. The badger's potentially puzzling statement hints at a definition of humanity far more profound than an arbitrary world-building technique, as the crucial place of people in Narnia mirrors Lewis' view of humanity's role in God's creation. This view appears most succinctly in The Screwtape Letters, where Screwtape's description of human beings as half physical, half spiritual \"amphibians\" directly and deliberately echoes Sir Thomas Browne, a seventeenth-century writer and physician. While it is not stated as explicitly in Narnia, Lewis expands this metaphor of amphibious humanity in his fictional world. For Lewis, as for Browne earlier, humanity's participation in two natures is an essential element of human self-hood, which although making humanity susceptible to fall, also grants a unique ability to participate in creation's redemption.    Lewis sees humanity as holding a distinctive place in Creation, and to describe this position he borrows a metaphor from Sir Thomas Browne, an author who was part of the fabric of Lewis' own scholarship. Writing in the mid-1600's, Browne is known for his work in early science, what was then called \"natural philosophy;' and for his early work Religio Medici, or \"the religion of a doctor,\" in which he describes his beliefs about God and the world. Lewis, as a literary scholar, knew Browne's writing well, as demonstrated by Lewis' works of literary criticism. References to Browne appear, for instance, in The Discarded Image and English Literature of the Sixteenth Century. (1) However, Lewis' interest was more than scholarly. In Surprised By Joy, Lewis explains how, even before his conversion, he was most attracted to religious writers, whose works contained a depth \"on whom I could really feed\" (213), and the then-atheist Lewis finds that he is, paradoxically, \"deeply and lastingly satisfied by Thomas Browne\" (214). The two writers also share some interesting parallels. Like Lewis, Browne participated in a profession assumed to be conducive to atheism and wrote not as a theologian to theologians, but as a professional man to other lay people, provoking both acclaim and controversy.

A man is caught and convicted.  The evidence against him is overwhelming.  Everyone is satisfied that the murderer is behind bars.  Everyone except Briggs.  \nArmed with only a few inconsistencies and his belief that the convicted man was framed, Briggs begins his search to find the motive for these senseless and seemingly random acts of violence.

Three out of five companies, polled in a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers survey, have outsourced at least some business processes, and a 2008 Deloitte Consulting Outsourcing Report suggested that \"83% of respondents reported that their projects had met their ROI goals of slightly above 25%.\"    And yet, business is littered with stories of outsourcing projects that fail--or perhaps, more importantly, fail to stay the distance. There are initial gains, certainly, but followed by a relationship that descends into acrimony. Some partnerships, such as the 20-year alliance between Jaguar and Unipart Logistics, just keep on delivering for both parties; others run into the sand. This perplexed the United States Air Force (USAF), which spends more than $60 billion a year with outsourcing partners. Why are some deals, such as that of GE with the US Navy for maintenance of the J404 aircraft engine, so successful, whilst other apparently similar deals disappoint or fail?

I've seen just one technique of the 20 included increase students' performances two letter grades in a very short period of time.  That's right. Just one of these eye-opening approaches to learning math can make the difference between failing and passing.  How important is that math grade? As important as completing the degree since I'm sure you have to pass a general studies or higher math course to complete your program and graduate.  The insights and techniques I share in this book came from my years as a high school math and physics teacher, from my subsequent years as a math coordinator at a university tutoring and support center, from years of teaching College Algebra for non-traditional and traditional students, and 13 years as a department chairperson in a university teacher education department.

This was Roll's (1988) conjecture; such OLS-residual information is termed Idiosyncratic Risk [IR]. Further, recognizing that the generation of IR information requires the use of the OLS-filter, we examine the effect of attending to the assumptions of the OLS-filter, in particular screening for outliers, on the market analysis of traded firms. The outlier screens used were: Trimming, Box-Plot CC-Screens, and Mahalanobis relational screen.

His two earliest, and perhaps most accessible, successes\u2014A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Dubliners\u2014are here brought together in one volume. Both works reflect Joyce\u2019s lifelong love-hate relationship with Dublin and the Irish culture that formed him.\n\nIn the semi-autobiographical Portrait, young Stephen Dedalus yearns to be an artist, but first must struggle against the forces of church, school, and society, which fetter his imagination and stifle his soul. The book\u2019s inventive style is apparent from its opening pages, a record of an infant\u2019s impressions of the world around him\u2014and one of the first examples of the \u201cstream of consciousness\u201d technique.\n\nComprising fifteen stories, Dubliners presents a community of mesmerizing, humorous, and haunting characters\u2014a group portrait. The interactions among them form one long meditation on the human condition, culminating with \u201cThe Dead,\u201d one of Joyce\u2019s most graceful compositions centering around a character\u2019s epiphany. A carefully woven tapestry of Dublin life at the turn of the last century, Dubliners realizes Joyce\u2019s ambition to give his countrymen \u201cone good look at themselves.\u201d\n\nKevin J. H.

Events, such as the proclamation of the Republic in 1931, the outburst of the Civil War (1936-1939), and the influence of the avant-gardes and the utopian movements, created a society in motion and offered women new possibilities. A few dared to take advantage of this situation and entered the political field or became artists. However, their names, unlike those of their male counterparts, have fallen into oblivion. While the works of Federico Garcia Lorca, Luis Bunuel, or Salvador Dali are what can be considered \"common knowledge,\" only a few art critics are familiar with those of Maruja Mallo, Rosario de Velasco, and Angeles Santos. This is particularly surprising since these women's presence in the avant-garde is well-documented, and even some of their paintings are exhibited at the Reina Sofia Museum of Modern Art in Madrid. There currently is an attempt to revive these artists' experiences, but there is still a long way ahead.    This enterprise should include not only the study of the artists per se, but also that of the representation of women artists in the media, literature and society in general. These representations reflect how Spanish female painters were seen at the time, and help us identify the prejudices and expectations that they had to face. Since there is evidence that there were a considerable number of women artists in Spain in the 20s and 30s, one should assume that they would have provided ample inspiration for writers to create female characters devoted to painting. This does not seem to have been the case, and it is extremely hard to find texts from that period that depict women artists. Behind this absence, there is a strong opposition to the idea of a female genius, which will likely bring along a questioning of the overpowering male genius. A similar idea is stated by Virginia Woolf in A Room of One's Own (1929), in which she concludes that men's insistence on female inferiority aims at keeping up the belief in male superiority (34).

Joyce is best known for Ulysses (1922), a landmark novel which perfected his stream of consciousness technique and combined nearly every literary device available in a modern re-telling of The Odyssey. Other major works are the short-story collection Dubliners (1914), and the novels A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and Finnegans Wake (1939). His complete oeuvre includes three books of poetry, a play, occasional journalism, and his published letters.<br>\nThough most of his adult life was spent abroad, Joyce's fictional universe did not extend beyond Dublin, and it is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there; Ulysses in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city.

The collection explores, and in some instances refutes, assumptions about the unmediated nature of portraits in early modern cultural production that have been constantly employed but infrequently questioned. These essays join the growing, and crucially needed, body of work that faces portraits with a range of different concerns, and replaces former \"certainties\" with beneficial doubts. Long-held assumptions concerning verisimilitude tend to adhere particularly to portraits made during the Renaissance, when techniques for recording physiognomic likeness were consolidated and conventions or visual devices for the representation of gender, class, professional status, and power were established. The combination, in the hands of highly ambitious and hugely virtuosic painters, was, and is still, irresistible. We are dazzled and prepared to believe that Titian's sitters, or Raphael's, or Sebastiano del Piombo's, were as splendid as the skill of the artist was able to reveal. It is difficult, and no fun, to detach ourselves enough to acknowledge the artifice and to analyze the elements that fabricated such overwhelming, yet still believable, human perfection and magnificence. In part we believe it because we so desire it, and because it is reassuring to imagine a time when a noble humanity was straightforwardly recorded by the talented artists it deserved.    It is no surprise that the influence of the Renaissance paradigm pervaded the early modern practice of portrait-making, and continues still to operate in much criticism and history. But more problems lurk beyond the common attribution of objectivity to naturalistic visual representation, especially the modern variety of mental baggage conditioned by our experience of the snapshot. It makes us unthinking captives of the simplistic equation: representation of an individual person equals the candid capture of a moment in time. Even more undermining of this facile view is the path taken by socio-cultural developments. The social and cultural context of western art has gradually called into question the stability of identity, and along with it the easy correspondence of bodily aspect and interior make-up. Yet still, the function of the portrait to express primarily the identity and subjectivity of the sitter remains for the most part an unquestioned tenet in study of the genre.", "trackName": "The Erotic Souvenir As a Portrait of the Artist (Critical Essay)", "trackId": 526114655, "price": 5.99, "artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/annali-ditalianistica/id486061743?mt=11&uo=4", "artworkUrl100": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/91/7a/4c/917a4c77-7b18-afd4-f6ce-be62a326046e/182336902.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "1998-01-01T08:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 486061743, "artistIds": ["list", 486061743], "artworkUrl60": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/91/7a/4c/917a4c77-7b18-afd4-f6ce-be62a326046e/182336902.60x60-50.jpg", "artistName": "Annali d'Italianistica", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/erotic-souvenir-as-portrait/id526114655?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Language Arts & Disciplines", "Books", "Professional & Technical", "Education"]}, {"trackCensoredName": "Portrait of the Artist as a Young God", "genreIds": ["list", "9031", "38", "9020"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "So what if you can make stars explode or change the orbits of elemental electrons.

Is it possible that the KKK is right? They claim that their job on Blacks are done, because a set of black hip hop artists from the \"wormwood\" of society are doing a better job at demeaning and abusing Black people, especially Black women. They are the neoclassical poets of the ghetto. The White classical poets put their women on a pedestal, the neoclassical made them approachable and attainable; but these worms that infest the earth and furniture of ghetto life drag women down, Black women, and transform them into bitches, w***es, and used-up chattel. But maybe this disease has spread deeper than that. And the KKK has missed the point. Novel Thomas in his article, \"Of Dogs and Humans, Who Do You Love More?\" (Community Contact 29, August 2007) strongly suggests that the human race has become participants in a pit bull fight to the death for no other reason than that they have become loveless creatures that have forfeited the benefit of redemption that comes with the capacity to love. David Banner is a screwed up hip hop \"artist\", a graduate from uncle Screw tapes' correspondence school (Cf. C. S. Lewis, Screw Tape Letters: From a Senior Devil to a Junior Devil). He has lost love and its conscience. He is somewhere in the valley of the dead looking for it, before he passes into another life. Will it be a hell where eternally he chokes on the bile of hate which he can never completely vomit? Or will he discover self respect, hope and purpose beyond the damnation of self-destructive hat?. Uncle Screw tape has got David Banner in his grip, locked in the bottomless pit of denial, beyond the unconscious. Are David Banner and his wormwood pals by nature depraved, as the KKK might claim? No. But they have become so. Is their history one of victims of abuse, disadvantaged, enslaved, valued only for their physical properties, equated to chattel, abandoned and left fatherless? Yes. They are clearly not blessed with the patience of Job; and Uncle Screw Tape has got them trapped in the brutal brilliance of his deception. For they believe that they are artists and that that gives them the right to say whatever they want, an illusion of democracy without responsibility. I will not question their claims to being artists for art has never stopped anyone from being vile, nor nations from looting, pillaging raping and destroying other nations. Art has not stopped the White man from turning the White woman into sex objects and bribing her to play the role. The issue then is not whether they are artists but whether their artistic expressions destroy their souls and the souls of others.", "trackName": "A Portrait of the Artist As a Deviant: Turn the Switch off on \"No Snitching\" (Critical Essay)", "trackId": 485324643, "price": 5.99, "artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/kola/id485324844?mt=11&uo=4", "artworkUrl100": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/19/93/a9/mzi.kdgcgilt.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2009-06-22T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 485324844, "artistIds": ["list", 485324844], "artworkUrl60": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/19/93/a9/mzi.kdgcgilt.60x60-50.jpg", "artistName": "Kola", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/portrait-artist-as-deviant/id485324643?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Social Science", "Books", "Nonfiction", "Professional & Technical", "Education", "Language Arts & Disciplines"]}, {"trackCensoredName": "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man", "genreIds": ["list", "10049", "38", "9031", "10042"], "kind": "ebook", "artistName": "James Joyce", "description": "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a semi-autobiographical novel by James Joyce, first serialised in the magazine The Egoist from 1914 to 1915, and published first in book format in 1916 by B. W. Huebsch, New York. The first English edition was published by the Egoist Press in February 1917. The story describes the formative years of the life of Stephen Dedalus, a fictional alter ego of Joyce and an allusion to the consummate craftsman of Greek mythology, Daedalus.<br>\n<br>\nA novel written in Joyce's characteristic free indirect speech style, A Portrait is a major example of the K\u00fcnstlerroman (an artist's Bildungsroman) in English literature. Joyce's novel traces the intellectual and religio-philosophical awakening of young Stephen Dedalus as he begins to question and rebel against the Catholic and Irish conventions with which he has been raised. He finally leaves for abroad to pursue his ambitions as an artist. The work is an early example of some of Joyce's modernist techniques that would later be represented in a more developed manner by Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. The novel, which has had a \"huge influence on novelists across the world\", was ranked by Modern Library as the third greatest English-language novel of the 20th century.<br>\n<br>\nExpertly formatted with a linked table of contents.

Popular gothic novelists like Stephen King include plenty of sacrificial children in their novels, as is the case in his own The Shining, Firestarter, It, and Pet Sematary. King's use of the sacrificial child might be read as unfair exploitation of the suffering of victimised or monstrous children for commercial ends in entertaining fiction verging on the pornographic. Actually, as this paper argues, his portrait of the child is part of King's constant criticism of the American style of life, which is gradually excluding the imaginary from the relationship between parents and children. His fiction also reflects an evident anxiety about parenthood on the side of baby-boomers, especially white men like King himself. King's fiction is morally ambiguous about the father and child relationship because King may put his finger on the dark areas of the American lifestyle but lacks an answer as to how American society could protect its own children from the horrors adults inflict on them. Basically, his novels address morally autonomous readers capable of understanding the boundaries between exploitation and denunciation in contemporary horror. King's implicit moral message--be good to your children--is addressed to them. **********", "trackName": "Nightmares of Childhood: The Child and the Monster in Four Novels by Stephen King (The Shining; Firestarter; It; Pet Sematary)", "trackId": 510011908, "price": 5.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/45/45/39/45453972-5f36-c150-d6a2-c81f45e21fbb/119442680.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2001-06-01T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 483380349, "userRatingCount": 2, "averageUserRating": 1.5, "artworkUrl60": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/45/45/39/45453972-5f36-c150-d6a2-c81f45e21fbb/119442680.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Nightmares of Childhood: The Child and the Monster in Four Novels by Stephen King (The Shining; Firestarter; It; Pet Sematary)", "artistIds": ["list", 483380349], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/nightmares-childhood-child/id510011908?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Language Arts & Disciplines", "Books", "Professional & Technical", "Education"]}]}}, {"func_name": "Amazon.item_search", "_id": -6289632397256877411, "expiration": {"$date": 1343587196601}, "value": {"c": {"ItemSearchResponse": ["list", {"a": {"xmlns": "http://webservices.amazon.com/AWSECommerceService/2011-08-01"}, "c": {"Items": ["list", {"c": {"Request": ["list", {"c": {"IsValid": ["list", {"v": "False"}], "Errors": ["list", {"c": {"Error": ["list", {"c": {"Message": ["list", {"v": "Your request is missing required parameters.

It was also a land withered by drought and hunger, and a place where hope and opportunity were hard to find. But William had read about windmills in a book called Using Energy, and he dreamed of building one that would bring electricity and water to his village and change his life and the lives of those around him. His neighbors may have mocked him and called him misala&#151;crazy&#151;but William was determined to show them what a little grit and ingenuity could do.</p><p></p>Enchanted by the workings of electricity as a boy, William had a goal to study science in Malawi's top boarding schools. But in 2002, his country was stricken with a famine that left his family's farm devastated and his parents destitute. Unable to pay the eighty-dollar-a-year tuition for his education, William was forced to drop out and help his family forage for food as thousands across the country starved and died.<p></p>Yet William refused to let go of his dreams. With nothing more than a fistful of cornmeal in his stomach, a small pile of once-forgotten science textbooks, and an armory of curiosity and determination, he embarked on a daring plan to bring his family a set of luxuries that only two percent of Malawians could afford and what the West considers a necessity&#151;electricity and running water. Using scrap metal, tractor parts, and bicycle halves, William forged a crude yet operable windmill, an unlikely contraption and small miracle that eventually powered four lights, complete with homemade switches and a circuit breaker made from nails and wire. A second machine turned a water pump that could battle the drought and famine that loomed with every season.<p></p>Soon, news of William's <i>magetsi a mphepo</i>&#151;his \"electric wind\"&#151;spread beyond the borders of his home, and the boy who was once called crazy became an inspiration to those around the world.<p></p>Here is the remarkable story about human inventiveness and its power to overcome crippling adversity. <i>The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind</i> will inspire anyone who doubts the power of one individual's ability to change his community and better the lives of those around him.<p></p>", "trackName": "The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind", "trackId": 360632123, "price": 10.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/f8/de/71/mzi.btrrydnm.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2009-09-29T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 364556876, "userRatingCount": 75, "averageUserRating": 4.0, "artworkUrl60": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/f8/de/71/mzi.btrrydnm.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind", "artistIds": ["list", 364556876, 364556885], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-boy-who-harnessed-the-wind/id360632123?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Biographies & Memoirs", "Books"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/william-kamkwamba-bryan-mealer/id364556876?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "10082", "38", "9010"], "kind": "ebook", "artistName": "William Kamkwamba & Bryan Mealer", "description": "<DIV>When fourteen-year-old William Kamkwamba's Malawi village was hit by a drought, everyone's crops began to fail.

Each comes from a different background, but now, as grown women they find themselves facing the same struggles in the search for love.   Simone has a no-nonsense approach to men - She ain't puttin' up with no nonsense. As a 41 year-old single mother of a college student, she knows what she wants out of a man, and she's not afraid to demand it. When she meets Carlos, she thinks she's found THE one. A former baseball player, he's wealthy, sexy, and fantastic in the sheets. He seems like the perfect man for her. But is he too perfect?   Neshelle can count the men she's slept with on one hand. Her recent divorce from her high school sweetheart has left her totally unequipped to handle men in today's dating world. When an impulsive one-night stand results in shocking consequences, she spirals out of control briefly, but soon finds herself saved by an unexpected rescuer.   Imani has always been the quiet one of the trio. Patiently waiting for a wedding ring from her live-in boyfriend of ten years, she is devastated when she learns he cheated on her and fathered a baby with another woman. Believing her own lack of sexiness is the reason for his indiscretion, she goes to great lengths to change herself and her appearance. It's only when she meets a man who appreciates her for what's on the inside, that she truly believes she can love again.

The author argues that successful counterinsurgency requires effective indigenous security forces, especially police; a viable and legitimate local government; and the suppression of external support for insurgents.", "trackName": "Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan", "trackId": 378147492, "price": 9.99, "artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/seth-g.-jones/id378147493?mt=11&uo=4", "artworkUrl100": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/d6/4b/c7/mzi.nqcxuzgf.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2008-05-30T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 378147493, "userRatingCount": 2, "averageUserRating": 4.0, "artworkUrl60": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/d6/4b/c7/mzi.nqcxuzgf.60x60-50.jpg", "artistIds": ["list", 378147493], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/counterinsurgency-in-afghanistan/id378147492?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Politics & Current Events", "Books"]}, {"trackCensoredName": "Objectivism", "genreIds": ["list", "10091", "38", "9002"], "kind": "ebook", "artistName": "Leonard Peikoff", "description": "This brilliantly conceived and organized book is based on a lecture course given by Dr. Leonard Peikoff in 1976, entitled \"The Philosophy of Objectivism.\" The lectures were attended by Ayn Rand, who helped prepare them and also joined Peikoff in answering questions.

He covers every branch of philosophy recognized by Rand and every philosophic topic she regarded as important--from certainty to money, from logic to art, from measurement to sex. Illustrated with quotes from her published works, complete with an abundance of new material that Ayn Rand offered only in private conversations with Peikoff, these clear, cogent chapters illuminate Objectivism--and its creator--with startling clarity.

This predicament seems inevitable, but in fact it&#8217;s quite new. In medieval Europe, God&#8217;s calling was a grounding force. In ancient Greece, a whole pantheon of shining gods stood ready to draw an appropriate action out of you. Like an athlete in &#8220;the zone,&#8221; you were called to a harmonious attunement with the world, so absorbed in it that you couldn&#8217;t make a &#8220;wrong&#8221; choice. If our culture no longer takes for granted a belief in God, can we nevertheless get in touch with the Homeric moods of wonder and gratitude, and be guided by the meanings they reveal? <I>All Things Shining </I>says we can.Hubert Dreyfus and Sean Dorrance Kelly illuminate some of the greatest works of the West to reveal how we have lost our passionate engagement with and responsiveness to the world. Their journey takes us from the wonder and openness of Homer&#8217;s polytheism to the monotheism of Dante; from the autonomy of Kant to the multiple worlds of Melville; and, finally, to the spiritual difficulties evoked by modern authors such as David Foster Wallace and Elizabeth Gilbert.Dreyfus, a philosopher at the University of California, Berkeley, for forty years, is an original thinker who finds in the classic texts of our culture a new relevance for people&#8217;s everyday lives. His lively, thought-provoking lectures have earned him a podcast audience that often reaches the iTunesU Top 40. Kelly, chair of the philosophy department at Harvard University, is an eloquent new voice whose sensitivity to the sadness of the culture&#8212;and to what remains of the wonder and gratitude that could chase it away&#8212;captures a generation adrift.Re-envisioning modern spiritual life through their examination of literature, philosophy, and religious testimony, Dreyfus and Kelly unearth ancient sources of meaning, and teach us how to rediscover the sacred, shining things that surround us every day. This book will change the way we understand our culture, our history, our sacred practices, and ourselves. It offers a new&#8212;and very old&#8212;way to celebrate and be grateful for our existence in the modern world.", "trackName": "All Things Shining", "trackId": 382782076, "price": 9.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/e3/dc/70/mzi.fwdoivje.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2011-01-04T08:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 366444684, "userRatingCount": 24, "averageUserRating": 4.0, "artworkUrl60": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/e3/dc/70/mzi.fwdoivje.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "All Things Shining", "artistIds": ["list", 366444684, 366444689], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/all-things-shining/id382782076?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Religion & Spirituality", "Books", "Fiction & Literature", "Literary Criticism", "Nonfiction", "Philosophy"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/james-lee-burke/id2070165?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "9031", "38", "9032"], "kind": "ebook", "artistName": "James Lee Burke", "description": "A Simon & Schuster eBook.

CHARLOTTE OBSERVER  ABANDON [is] two separate works of past and present seamlessly melded together into a single novel that demands to be read in one sitting, so you can better appreciate the beauty of Crouch\u2019s storytelling\u2026[O]ne of those books that almost instantly puts you in the mind of a classic. BOOKREPORTER   Haunting, fast-paced, and thoroughly engrossing... ABANDON is one of the most original tales of ghosts, greed and gold I've come across. Crouch aligns both eras so perfectly, it's as if the characters are occupying the same breath within the space/time continuum. ABANDON will be one of the most talked-about books of the summer.

Archaic Terminology: The chapter traces the origins of early settlements of the northwestern region of Egypt, the desert oases, the Fayum, the region of the Lakes, and the western portion of the delta of the Nile, by Saharan and Libyan archaic people, with specific emphasis on archaic topography which can be directly related to Modern Amazigh spoken today in North Africa (Tamazirt.)</P><P>2,The Pillar People: The review of a number of terms from the mythology and ceremonial procedures of dynastic Egypt shows the influence of those early settlers named The People of the Pillars (Intui) on the beliefs and practices perpetuated through centuries in Egypt, and the presence of an all pervasive worship of these early origins: (cult of ancestors.)</P><P>3.The Holy rulers of First Princes of Egypt: An intensive comparative review of ancient Egyptian and Modern Amazigh terms reveals that the first noble rulers of the area were of Amazigh origin. A series of families of terms link quite clearly a number of beliefs and practices to the North African cultural complex.</P><P>4.Tehuti, time and the Wisdom of the stars is a chapter delving a little more deeply into the cosmogony and cosmology of the early Egyptians, and the roots of that knowledge in archaic practices, which have parallel indicators in North Africa.</P><P>5. The Innermost Shrine from The Book of the Dead: The geography of the Land of the Beyond, Tu-at (Du-Ament), and a variety of important indices throughout the Book of the Dead indicate quite clearly that the final return of the defunct to the Blessed Land of the Ancestors was also a step by step description of their claim of descent from these original beings. The rule of Ma-aa-at, the organizing principle of an entire civilization for centuries, or NTR, originated in the area of the Sacred lakes and the ancient settlements of the Fayum and oasis complex. Linguistic comparison with Modern Amazigh continues to indicate the kinship of those people with North African Imazighen (also known as Berbers.)</P><P>6. A Conclusion, Notes, and an Appendix, which is the reproduction of an article published in The Amazigh Voice, a publication of the Amazigh Cultural Association in America, indicate the pioneer aspect of such a work and the direction in which further linguistic studies could bring increasing light into areas of Egyptian scholarship heretofore deemed as obscure and/or of barbarous origin. .</P>", "trackName": "''the Shining Ones''", "trackId": 466399897, "price": 9.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/cc/f8/ee/mzi.eefotycc.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2001-08-17T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 466400345, "artistIds": ["list", 466400345], "artworkUrl60": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/cc/f8/ee/mzi.eefotycc.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "''the Shining Ones''", "artistName": "Helene E.

Popular gothic novelists like Stephen King include plenty of sacrificial children in their novels, as is the case in his own The Shining, Firestarter, It, and Pet Sematary. King's use of the sacrificial child might be read as unfair exploitation of the suffering of victimised or monstrous children for commercial ends in entertaining fiction verging on the pornographic. Actually, as this paper argues, his portrait of the child is part of King's constant criticism of the American style of life, which is gradually excluding the imaginary from the relationship between parents and children. His fiction also reflects an evident anxiety about parenthood on the side of baby-boomers, especially white men like King himself. King's fiction is morally ambiguous about the father and child relationship because King may put his finger on the dark areas of the American lifestyle but lacks an answer as to how American society could protect its own children from the horrors adults inflict on them. Basically, his novels address morally autonomous readers capable of understanding the boundaries between exploitation and denunciation in contemporary horror. King's implicit moral message--be good to your children--is addressed to them. **********", "trackName": "Nightmares of Childhood: The Child and the Monster in Four Novels by Stephen King (The Shining; Firestarter; It; Pet Sematary)", "trackId": 510011908, "price": 5.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/45/45/39/45453972-5f36-c150-d6a2-c81f45e21fbb/119442680.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2001-06-01T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 483380349, "userRatingCount": 2, "averageUserRating": 1.5, "artworkUrl60": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/45/45/39/45453972-5f36-c150-d6a2-c81f45e21fbb/119442680.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Nightmares of Childhood: The Child and the Monster in Four Novels by Stephen King (The Shining; Firestarter; It; Pet Sematary)", "artistIds": ["list", 483380349], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/nightmares-childhood-child/id510011908?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Language Arts & Disciplines", "Books", "Professional & Technical", "Education"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/bryan-northcutt/id470697053?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "10107", "38", "9018"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "Have a deeper understanding of God's Mercy and Grace.

He asks his students to write about an event that changed their lives, and one essay blows him away&#8212;a gruesome, harrowing story about the night more than fifty years ago when Harry Dunning&#8217;s father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a sledgehammer. Reading the essay is a watershed moment for Jake, his life&#8212;like Harry&#8217;s, like America&#8217;s in 1963&#8212;turning on a dime. Not much later his friend Al, who owns the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to the past, a particular day in 1958. And Al enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsession&#8212;to prevent the Kennedy assassination. <P>So begins Jake&#8217;s new life as George Amberson, in a different world of Ike and JFK and Elvis, of big American cars and sock hops and cigarette smoke everywhere.

Readers of Stephen King's epic series know Roland well, or as well as this enigmatic hero can be known.

Beyond the town, the rocky ground rises toward the hulking darkness of Thunderclap, the source of a terrible affliction that is slowly stealing the community's soul. One of the town's residents is Pere Callahan, a ruined priest who, like Susannah, Eddie, and Jake, passed through one of the portals that lead both into and out of Roland's world. <P> As Father Callahan tells the <I>ka-tet</I> the astonishing story of what happened following his shamed departure from Maine in 1977, his connection to the Dark Tower becomes clear, as does the danger facing a single red rose in a vacant lot off Second Avenue in midtown Manhattan. For Calla Bryn Sturgis, danger gathers in the east like a storm cloud. The Wolves of Thunderclap and their unspeakable depredation are coming.

Roland and Eddie are with John Cullum in Maine, in 1977, looking for the site on Turtleback Lane where \"walk-ins\" have been often seen. They want desperately to get back to the others, to Susannah especially, and yet they have come to realize that the world they need to escape is the only one that matters. <P> Thus the book opens, like a door to the uttermost reaches of Stephen King's imagination.

Per sua madre, per\u00f2, il fatto che si sia laureata conta ben poco: l'unica cosa che vuole per la figlia \u00e8 un buon matrimonio. Ma Skeeter \u00e8 molto diversa dalle sue amiche di un tempo, gi\u00e0 sposate e perfettamente inserite in un modello di vita borghese, e sogna in segreto di diventare scrittrice. L'unica persona che potrebbe comprenderla \u00e8 l'amatissima Constantine, la governante che l'ha cresciuta, ma la donna sembra svanita nel nulla e i tentativi di Skeet er di scoprire dove sia finita si infrangono contro un muro di silenzi imbarazzati. Come Constantine, anche Aibileen \u00e8 una domestica di colore. Saggia e materna, ha un candore e una pulizia interiore che abbagliano: per un tozzo di pane ha allevato amorevolmente uno dopo l'altro diciassette bambini bianchi, facendo le veci delle loro madri spesso assenti. Ma il destino \u00e8 stato crudele con lei, portandole via il suo unico figlio, morto in un incidente sul lavoro tra l'indifferenza generale. Da allora in Aibileen qualcosa si \u00e8 spezzato, e nulla sar\u00e0 pi\u00f9 come prima. Minny \u00e8 la sua migliore amica. Bassa, grassa, con un marito violento e una piccola trib\u00f9 di figli, \u00e8 con ogni probabilit\u00e0 la donna pi\u00f9 sfacciata e insolente di tutto il Mississippi. Cuoca straordinaria, non sa per\u00f2 tenere a freno la lingua e viene licenziata di continuo per le sue intemperanze, fino a quando \u00e8 assunta da una signora nuova del posto, che per la sua bellezza vistosa e le origini modeste \u00e8 messa al bando dalla buona societ\u00e0 bianca. Sono gli anni in cui Bob Dylan inizia a testimoniare con le sue canzoni la protesta nascente, e il colore della pelle \u00e8 ancora un ostacolo insormontabile.

But during the counseling session, the pastor continually avoided the issue of spousal abuse so evident within my marriage. Instead, he seemed to focus on what my role was as a wife. He told me to submit to my husband and try not to \u2018set him off.\u2019 The pastor also indicated I was expecting too much of my husband. Yet in all our counseling sessions, the pastor never told my husband about his biblical responsibility to love and care for me, his wife. And not once did the pastor ever reprimand my husband for his violence, ask him to step down from his leadership position, or refer him to a batterer\u2019s program. I left those counseling sessions feeling empty, believing God did not care for me at all...[Removing an eye patch which revealed a badly swollen eye and bruised face she asked], \u2018I truly hate him for hurting me like this, but what if I really do burn in hell for breaking up my marriage?

Should the Future Help the Past? <br>\nby Liam Gillick<br>\nHALMOS / \u220e (www.halmos.us.com)is pleased to announce the release of Samuel Madden's Memoirs of the Twentieth Century available for the first time in over 25 years. This new edition includes Liam Gillick's Prevision. Should the Future Help the Past?<br>\nWritten in 1733, Memoirs of the Twentieth Century is widely regarded to contain the earliest known conception of time-travel and, in particular, the first cognitive leap that would allow for a historicized image of the present as seen from the point of view of a distant future. Intriguingly, it is the text itself which is claimed to have traveled back in time and Madden has used this conceit to satirize his own period \u2013 tracing out its bureaucratic absurdities into a strange yet pointed vision of the late 20th century: a world politically fraught, overwhelmed with corruption and struggling to reconcile religious faith with scientific discovery.<br>\nThe mysterious publishing history of the book imparts a certain weight to its claims. Printed anonymously in an edition of 1000, all but 10 copies were immediately destroyed for unknown reasons. It would only be printed once more in 1972 and until now Memoirs... has been extremely scarce\u00a0resulting in disappointingly little scholarship. This new edition includes Liam Gillick's Prevision. Should the Future Help the Past first published in 1999, the very year when Memoirs... leaves off. Gillick explores the socio-political implications inherent in strategic attitudes towards the future with a critical eye to the 'scenario planning' of late capitalism. It provides a prescient framework for reconsidering Madden's text now, just over ten years on since its fictive origination and apocalyptic conclusion.<br>\nTo encourage further study, the complete text will be freely distributed electronically in conjunction with the mass-market paperback.\u00a0<br>\n<br>", "trackName": "Memoirs of the Twentieth Century & Prevision.

My wife wanted me gone but I wanted to save the marriage. I did everything in this book and we are now happily married again.   This book has step by step details to help prevent a divorce, save a marriage from an affair and make your family the number one thing in your life.   We all start relationships wanting to be happy but many things get in the way and over time things get sour.    How do people fall in love?   Love is a strange thing. It starts without us knowing it. Someone meets some of our needs and we build a slight affection for them. They meet more of our needs and the feeling grows. Before we know it there is love. This accidental action happens to single AND married people.    How do people fall out of love?   Love releases chemicals that make us happy. This chemical part of love last 12-36 months. Then actions and meeting needs takes over again. If we get busy or lazy and stop meeting the needs of our mate they fall out of love.    What are some ways to turn the problems around?   Start talking again, spend time together, do things for each other, GIVE to each other. Do something every day to make each others life better.   But even more important STOP fighting, STOP pushing buttons, STOP doing the things that annoy your partner. We build love by doing more good things than bad things. The habits of how we fight subtract a LOT of affection or love from our relationships. It takes away faster than we can add to it so we have to learn what NOT to do.  In the book I help you learn how to STOP subtracting affection from your relationship and how to add to it instead.  Men and women have different needs and over time we start filling OUR needs and our partner feels starved. I help you learn what your partner needs in their relationship.   What if only one of us wants to try? (In most cases of Adultery only one partner really wants to try but many marriages are still saved.)   Do the things I mentioned and expect nothing in return. Just keep doing them. Slowly you will rebuild like and then love.   We want to SAVE Marriages and Relationships.

Lion brings Tablet-style features to the desktop and laptop, integrating multi-touch gestures (inspired by iOS X and iDevices), full-screen apps, and a Launchpad for apps (that mimics the home screen for an iDevice). While Lion is not a major revolution in operating systems, it is filled with convenient interface tweaks that make it easier to use and more flexible than ever before.<br/>\n<br/>\nLion also borrows from Microsoft Windows the few user-interface features where Windows still had Apple beat and makes these features their own. Now users can resize windows from any corner (not just the bottom right) and enjoy the beauty and power of full screen apps. Ex-Windows users will also appreciate an update that now allows you to copy documents or folders from one location to another, even if a document or folder of the same name already exists in the new location. Just like Windows, Lion will let you choose to either merge or replace the existing folder, or copy the entire folder and add a number to the file name.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis guide will provide an overview of the new features in Lion, including multi-touch trackpad gestures, cover the basics of what to expect when switching to Lion from Windows, and highlight tips and tricks for customizing the new operating system and getting the most out of Lion.

Through his research and experience, he has developed four basic principles that are crucial for understanding babies as well as improving their sleep and soothing their senses:<br><br>&#183;<b>The Missing Fourth Trimester:</b> as odd as it may sound, one of the main reasons babies cry is because they are born three months too soon.<br><br>&#183;<b>The Calming Reflex:</b> the automatic reset switch to stop crying of any baby in the first few months of life.<br><br>&#183;<b>The 5 &#8220;S&#8217;s&#8221;:</b> the simple steps (swaddling, side/stomach position, shushing, swinging and sucking) that trigger the calming reflex.  For centuries, parents have tried these methods only to fail because, as with a knee reflex, the calming reflex only works when it is triggered in precisely the right way.  Unlike other books that merely list these techniques Dr. Karp teaches parents exactly how to do them, to guide cranky infants to calm and easy babies to serenity in minutes&#8230;and help them sleep longer too.<br><br>&#183;<b>The Cuddle Cure:</b> the perfect mix the 5 &#8220;S&#8217;s&#8221; that can soothe even the most colicky of infants.<br><br>In the book, Dr. Karp also explains:<br><br>What is colic?<br><br>Why do most babies get much more upset in the evening?<br><br>How can a parent calm a baby--in mere minutes?<br><br>Can babies be spoiled?<br><br>When should a parent of a crying baby call the doctor?<br><br>How can a parent get their baby to sleep a few hours longer?<br><br>Even the most loving moms and dads sometimes feel pushed to the breaking point by their infant&#8217;s persistent cries.  Coming to the rescue, however, Dr. Karp places in the hands of parents, grandparents, and all childcare givers the tools they need to be able to calm their babies almost as easily as&#8230;turning off a light.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>", "trackName": "The Happiest Baby on the Block", "trackId": 419973031, "price": 10.99, "artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/harvey-karp-m.d./id419970278?mt=11&uo=4", "artworkUrl100": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/3d/8c/4e/3d8c4ee5-1afa-134d-9603-ede01ed55eb3/9780307485809.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2002-05-28T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 419970278, "userRatingCount": 137, "averageUserRating": 4.0, "artworkUrl60": "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/3d/8c/4e/3d8c4ee5-1afa-134d-9603-ede01ed55eb3/9780307485809.60x60-50.jpg", "artistIds": ["list", 419970278], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-happiest-baby-on-the-block/id419973031?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Family & Relationships", "Books", "Nonfiction", "Parenting"]}, {"trackCensoredName": "Learn Basic Math Now", "genreIds": ["list", "10085", "38", "9019", "9033"], "kind": "ebook", "artistName": "Minute Help Guides", "description": "Do you struggle with math, but need to learn it NOW?

She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells&mdash;taken without her knowledge&mdash;became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first &ldquo;immortal&rdquo; human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they&rsquo;d weigh more than 50 million metric tons&mdash;as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb&rsquo;s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. <br><br>Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.<br><br>Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the &ldquo;colored&rdquo; ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta&rsquo;s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia&mdash;a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo&mdash;to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells. <br><br>Henrietta&rsquo;s family did not learn of her &ldquo;immortality&rdquo; until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family&mdash;past and present&mdash;is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of. <br><br>Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family&mdash;especially Henrietta&rsquo;s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother&rsquo;s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn&rsquo;t her children afford health insurance?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, <i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i> captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.", "trackName": "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks", "trackId": 418646893, "price": 9.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/1e/27/32/mzi.upwdiuby.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2010-02-02T08:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 350232621, "userRatingCount": 1136, "averageUserRating": 4.5, "artworkUrl60": "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/1e/27/32/mzi.upwdiuby.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks", "artistIds": ["list", 350232621], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/immortal-life-henrietta-lacks/id418646893?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Social Science", "Books", "Nonfiction", "Science & Nature", "History", "Biographies & Memoirs"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/behind-the-story/id536787573?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "9008", "38"], "kind": "ebook", "description": "Loved the novel?

Wells, first published in 1895 and later directly adapted into at least two feature films of the same name, as well as two television versions, and a large number of comic book adaptations. It indirectly inspired many more works of fiction in all media. This 38,000 word novella is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposefully and selectively. The term \"time machine\", coined by Wells, is now universally used to refer to such a vehicle. It was also inspired by Charles Darwin and On the Origin of Species, showing us humans that have evolved into different species.

It indirectly inspired many more works of fiction in many media. This 32,000 word story is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposefully and selectively. The term \"time machine\", coined by Wells, is now universally used to refer to such a vehicle.

He will not only ingeniously describe for you a scientific miracle, but he will set down that miracle in the midst of a country village, sketching with excellent humour the inn-landlady, the blacksmith, the chemist\u2019s apprentice, the doctor, and all the other persons whom the miracle affects.\u201d\n\nAlfred Mac Adam teaches literature at Barnard College-Columbia University.

G. Wells 1895 novel which crafts a vivid and haunting picture of an earth some 800,000 years into the future. The first novel about time travel, \"The Time Machine\" was written during a period of great technological advancement, the impacts of which were of serious concern to Wells. The author poses the question in the novel; will technology ever go too far? The future world of the 'Eloi', depicted in the novel, warns of the dangerous consequences of unchecked technological advancements. Also included in this edition is another of Wells' most popular works, \"The Invisible Man\". It is the story of a scientist, Griffen, who discovers a serum that will turn his entire body invisible. The initial excitement over the possibilities quickly dissipates when Griffen, who uses the formula on himself, is unable to turn himself visible again. \"The Invisible Man\" is a cautionary tale about tampering with the laws of the universe. It is the story of how one scientist's great discovery leads him into a state of madness.

ABOUT THE BOOK: \"The Time Machine\" is considered by many to be one of the finest works of English fiction. This highly entertaining novella has had an enormous influence on English fiction in general and science fiction in particular. Even the term 'The Time Machine' (coined by Wells) is now used universally to refer to hypothetical machines capable of time travel. An unnamed observer is the narrator of the story about the time traveler who uses his machine to travel to the future. The narrator relates the time traveler's adventures as told to him by the traveler upon his return. It includes travels to far distant futures and meetings with strange adaptations of humans like the Eloi and the Morlocks. The book contains a wealth of fascinating ideas and theories, many of which are still discussed today. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: H.G. Wells was born in Bromley, England, the son of an unsuccessful merchant. After a limited education, he was apprenticed to a dry-goods merchant, but soon found he wanted something more out of life. He read widely and got a position as a student assistant in a secondary school, eventually winning a scholarship to the College of Science in South Kensington, where he studied biology under the British biologist and educator, Thomas Henry Huxley. After graduating, Wells took several different teaching positions and began writing for magazines. When his stories began to sell, he left teaching to write full time. Wells's first major novel, The Time Machine (1895), launched his career as a writer, and he began to produce a steady stream of science-fiction tales, short stories, realistic novels, and books of sociology, history,...", "trackName": "The Time Machine", "trackId": 458846784, "price": 2.99, "artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/h.g.-wells/id2124237?mt=11&uo=4", "artworkUrl100": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/37/c8/78/mzi.qyawfznz.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2011-08-04T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 2124237, "artistIds": ["list", 2124237], "artworkUrl60": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/37/c8/78/mzi.qyawfznz.60x60-50.jpg", "artistName": "H.G.

The world he finds is peopled by two races: the decadent Eloi, fluttery and useless, are dependent for food, clothing, and shelter on the simian subterranean Morlocks, who prey on them.

This 38,000 word novella is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposefully and selectively. The term \"time machine\", coined by Wells, is now universally used to refer to such a vehicle. It was also inspired by Charles Darwin and On the Origin of Species, showing us humans that have evolved into different species.

G. Wells, published in 1895 for the first time and later adapted into at least two feature films of the same name, as well as two television versions, and a large number of comic book adaptations. It indirectly inspired many more works of fiction in many media. This 32,000 word story is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposefully and selectively. The term \"time machine\", coined by Wells, is now universally used to refer to such a vehicle. Wells also introduced the idea of time being the \"fourth dimension\", as well as an early example of the Dying Earth subgenre.<br>\n<br>\n<b>FEATURES:</b><br>\n<b></b><br>\n\t\u2022\tIncludes beautiful artworks and illustrations\u00a0<br>\n\t\u2022\tA link of a FREE audio book to download at the end of the book<br>\n\t\u2022\tActive Table of Contents for an easy navigation within the book<br>\n\t\u2022\tSaves space and don\u2019t have to carry a hard copy around<br>\n\t\u2022\tOffers an easy access and convenience to this classic literary masterpiece for a reasonable price<br>\n\t\u2022\tGives a lasting entertainment and values for readers of all ages", "trackName": "The Time Machine", "trackId": 506511885, "price": 0.99, "artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/h.g.-wells/id2124237?mt=11&uo=4", "artworkUrl100": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/ba/97/e8/mzi.vvhqmpla.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2012-02-28T08:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 2124237, "userRatingCount": 1, "averageUserRating": 5.0, "artworkUrl60": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/ba/97/e8/mzi.vvhqmpla.60x60-50.jpg", "artistIds": ["list", 2124237], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-time-machine/id506511885?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Classics", "Books", "Fiction & Literature", "Sci-Fi & Fantasy", "Science Fiction & Literature", "High Tech"]}, {"trackCensoredName": "50 Classic Books Made Into Movies: Volume 2", "genreIds": ["list", "10042", "38", "9031"], "kind": "ebook", "artistName": "H.

In <I>Breaking the Time Barrier,</I> bestselling author Jenny Randles reveals the nature of recent, breakthrough experiments that are turning this fantasy into reality. <P> The race to build the first time machine is a fascinating saga that began about a century ago, when scientists such as Marconi and Edison and Einstein carried out research aimed at producing a working time machine. Today, physicists are conducting remarkable experiments that involve slowing the passage of information, freezing light, and breaking the speed of light--and thus the time barrier. In the 1960s we had the \"space race.\" Today, there is a \"time race\" involving an underground community of working scientists who are increasingly convinced that a time machine of some sort is finally possible. <P> Here, Randles explores the often riveting motives of the people involved in this quest (including a host of sincere, if sometimes misguided amateurs), the consequences for society should time travel become a part of everyday life, and what evidence might indicate that it has already become reality. For, if time travel is going to happen--and some Russian scientists already claim to have achieved it in a lab--then its effects may already be apparent.", "trackName": "Breaking the Time Barrier", "trackId": 381502101, "price": 11.99, "artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/jenny-randles/id358484061?mt=11&uo=4", "artworkUrl100": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/6c/40/23/mzi.itqzsghr.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2005-04-05T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 358484061, "userRatingCount": 1, "averageUserRating": 3.0, "artworkUrl60": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/6c/40/23/mzi.itqzsghr.60x60-50.jpg", "artistIds": ["list", 358484061], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/breaking-the-time-barrier/id381502101?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "History", "Books", "Science & Nature"]}, {"trackCensoredName": "Time Machine and The Invisible Man (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)", "genreIds": ["list", "10042", "38", "9031", "10065"], "kind": "ebook", "artistName": "H.G.

He will not only ingeniously describe for you a scientific miracle, but he will set down that miracle in the midst of a country village, sketching with excellent humour the inn-landlady, the blacksmith, the chemist\u2019s apprentice, the doctor, and all the other persons whom the miracle affects.\u201d\n\nAlfred Mac Adam teaches literature at Barnard College-Columbia University.

G. Wells 1895 novel which crafts a vivid and haunting picture of an earth some 800,000 years into the future. The first novel about time travel, \"The Time Machine\" was written during a period of great technological advancement, the impacts of which were of serious concern to Wells. The author poses the question in the novel; will technology ever go too far? The future world of the 'Eloi', depicted in the novel, warns of the dangerous consequences of unchecked technological advancements. Also included in this edition is another of Wells' most popular works, \"The Invisible Man\". It is the story of a scientist, Griffen, who discovers a serum that will turn his entire body invisible. The initial excitement over the possibilities quickly dissipates when Griffen, who uses the formula on himself, is unable to turn himself visible again. \"The Invisible Man\" is a cautionary tale about tampering with the laws of the universe. It is the story of how one scientist's great discovery leads him into a state of madness.

Andrew suffers from an incurable illness. To get better he would need penicillin which did not exist then.   Mattia listens to the interesting story and feels sorry for such an unfortunate little boy, not only because his life is at risk, but also because he and his family have been abandoned by his father. Seeing him suddenly overcome with fatigue, Mattia\u2019s father decides to let him sleep. Then, just as he is about to fall asleep, Father Christmas appears. He invites him on a journey back through time so that he can take the little boy the medicine he needs to get better. Mattia accepts Father Christmas\u2019s suggestion and, thanks to his sleigh pulled through the sky by the reindeer, Mattia travels one hundred years back in time.

In the wake of the Fail Decade, Americans have historically low levels of trust in their institutions; the social contract between ordinary citizens and elites lies in tatters.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did we get here? With <i>Twilight of the Elites</i>, Christopher Hayes offers a radically novel answer. Since the 1960s, as the meritocracy elevated a more diverse group of men and women into power, they learned to embrace the accelerating inequality that had placed them near the very top. Their ascension heightened social distance and spawned a new American elite--one more prone to failure and corruption than any that came before it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixing deft political analysis, timely social commentary, and deep historical understanding, <i>Twilight of the Elites</i> describes how the society we have come to inhabit &ndash; utterly forgiving at the top and relentlessly punitive at the bottom &ndash; produces leaders who are out of touch with the people they have been trusted to govern. Hayes argues that the public's failure to trust the federal government, corporate America, and the media has led to a crisis of authority that threatens to engulf not just our politics but our day-to-day lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upending well-worn ideological and partisan categories, Hayes entirely reorients our perspective on our times. <i>Twilight of the Elites</i> is the defining work of social criticism for the post-bailout age.", "trackName": "Twilight of the Elites", "trackId": 468719632, "price": 12.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/6d/df/6d/mzi.jrxccklq.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2012-06-12T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 497249376, "userRatingCount": 97, "averageUserRating": 4.0, "artworkUrl60": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/6d/df/6d/mzi.jrxccklq.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Twilight of the Elites", "artistIds": ["list", 497249376], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/twilight-of-the-elites/id468719632?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Politics & Current Events", "Books", "Business & Personal Finance"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/stephenie-meyer/id186957897?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "10081", "38", "9010"], "kind": "ebook", "artistName": "Stephenie Meyer", "description": "This stunning set, complete with five editions of <em>Twilight</em>, <em>New  Moon</em>, <em>Eclipse</em>, <em>Breaking Dawn</em>, and <em>The Short  Second Life of Bree Tanner: An Eclipse Novella, </em>makes the perfect  gift for fans of the bestselling vampire love story.<br><br>Deeply  romantic and extraordinarily suspenseful, The Twilight Saga capture the  struggle between defying our instincts and satisfying our desires.", "trackName": "The Twilight Saga Complete Collection", "trackId": 395523484, "price": 46.99, "artworkUrl100": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/90/bd/4a/mzi.idlbysoa.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2010-11-08T08:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 186957897, "userRatingCount": 389, "averageUserRating": 4.5, "artworkUrl60": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/90/bd/4a/mzi.idlbysoa.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "The Twilight Saga Complete Collection", "artistIds": ["list", 186957897], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/twilight-saga-complete-collection/id395523484?mt=11&uo=4", "genres": ["list", "Children's Fiction", "Books", "Children & Teens"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/caroline-pridham/id366210695?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "9031", "38"], "kind": "ebook", "artistName": "Caroline Pridham", "trackName": "Twilight and Dawn", "trackId": 506091507, "price": 0.0, "artworkUrl100": "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/e9/a9/5d/e9a95d99-eda2-b13f-ad04-abb753e7d2b6/coverArt.26a2e2.100x100-75.jpg", "releaseDate": "2005-05-01T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "artistId": 366210695, "userRatingCount": 4, "artworkUrl60": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Publication/v4/e9/a9/5d/e9a95d99-eda2-b13f-ad04-abb753e7d2b6/coverArt.26a2e2.60x60-50.jpg", "trackCensoredName": "Twilight and Dawn", "artistIds": ["list", 366210695], "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/twilight-and-dawn/id506091507?mt=11&uo=4", "averageUserRating": 4.0, "genres": ["list", "Fiction & Literature", "Books"]}, {"artistViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/stephenie-meyer/id186957897?mt=11&uo=4", "genreIds": ["list", "10081", "38", "9010"], "kind": "ebook", "artistName": "Stephenie Meyer", "description": "Fans of the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Twilight Saga will treasure this definitive <em>official</em> guide! <br><br>This must-have eBook edition-the only <em>official</em> guide-is the definitive encyclopedic reference to the Twilight Saga and provides readers with everything they need to further explore the unforgettable world Stephenie Meyer created in <i>Twilight</i>,<i> New Moon</i>,<i> Eclipse</i>, <i>Breaking Dawn</i>,<i> </i>and <i>The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner</i>.

Those who are infected become mindless zombies he controls and in turn those infected infect others. Will anyone be able to stop Anubis?  As the seasons... Things change...  Kat (the Pandora Project) looks to start a new life. The first thing she has to do is find a job. With the help of her neighbor Zax, she finds a delivery position at Sphinx Corporation Third Branch Office. Little does she know what waits for her in six days.  Can something lost... Be found?  Kimberly Griffin (The Phoenix) searches for Kat. Kim can't leave things as they ended with her. With the help of Stephanie (Cerberus), Kim scours Noir.
