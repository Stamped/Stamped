Dr. Eve Sheridan (Marcia Strassman in the pilot than played by (Mary McDonnell), his no-nonsense boss at the hospital, wished he would take things a little more seriously and not work such long shifts.

Serfs were for most purposes considered the property of the landowner, and could be bought, sold or mortgaged, as any other chattel. To count serfs (and people in general), the measure word \"soul\" was used: e.g., \"six souls of serfs\". The plot of the novel relies on \"dead souls\" (i.e., \"dead serfs\") which are still accounted for in property registers. On another level, the title refers to the \"dead souls\" of Gogol's characters, all of which visualise different aspects of poshlost (an untranslatable Russian word which is perhaps best rendered as \"self-satisfied inferiority\", moral and spiritual, with overtones of middle-class pretentiousness, fake significance and philistinism).</Overview>\n<FirstAired>1984-07-26</FirstAired>\n<IMDB_ID>tt0168084</IMDB_ID>\n<id>260997</id>\n</Series>\n<Series>\n<seriesid>77728</seriesid>\n<language>en</language>\n<SeriesName>Sherlock Holmes (1984)</SeriesName>\n<banner>graphical/77728-g3.jpg</banner>\n<Overview>This series (made by Granada between 1984 and 1994) featuring the late Jeremy Brett as the eponymous detective includes The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Return of Sherlock Holmes, The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes, The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, The Sign of Four, and The Hound of the Baskervilles.

The two Warner Brothers \u201dtalky Yakko and Liverpool-accented Wakko\u201d and their Warner Sister, Dot (\"I'm cute\") had supposedly been created in the 1930's, but their cartoons were too screwball for the general public. The three Warners (all black with long ears, but no distinguishable species or breed) were locked up in the studio water tower until they escaped in the early 1990's.

However, everything that could possibly go wrong indeed DOES go wrong. Officer Gunderson's outwardly homespun and folksy persona conceals a penetrating mind and a fierce moral compass, and she easily sees through the poorly executed and badly hidden events perpetrated by the bumbling, yet highly dangerous kidnappers (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare).

In a genre that exists to hype films before their release, Lost in La Mancha presents an unexpected twist: it is the story of a film that does not exist.  Following Terry Gilliam's attempt to bring Don Quixote to the big screen, Lost in La Mancha offers a unique, in-depth look at the harsher realities of filmmaking.  With drama that ranges from personal conflicts to epic storms, this is a record of a film disintegrating. In the best tradition of documentary filmmaking, Lost in La Mancha captures all the drama of this story through \"fly-on-the-wall\" verite footage and on-the-spot interviews. Gilliam's plans for the non-existent film come alive in animations of his storyboards, narrated and voiced by co-writer Tony Grisoni and Gilliam himself. And with the camera tests of the leading actors and the rushes from the only six days of photography, Lost in La Mancha offers a tantalizing glimpse of the cinematic spectacle that might have been. Lost in La Mancha is less a process piece about filmmakers at work and more a powerful drama about the inherent fragility of the creative process -- a compelling study of how, even with an abundance of the best will and passion, the artistic endeavor can remain an impossible dream.", "kind": "feature-movie", "country": "USA", "wrapperType": "track", "artworkUrl100": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/026/Music/b0/17/99/dj.byfpbfjr.100x100-75.jpg", "artistName": "Keith Fulton & Louis Pepe", "artworkUrl60": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/026/Music/b0/17/99/dj.byfpbfjr.60x60-50.jpg", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "artworkUrl30": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/026/Music/b0/17/99/dj.byfpbfjr.30x30-50.jpg"}, {"contentAdvisoryRating": "R", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "releaseDate": "2001-05-29T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "previewUrl": "http://a118.v.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/054/Video/79/46/91/mzm.birnznon..640x364.h264lc.d2.p.m4v", "trackPrice": 9.99, "discCount": 1, "collectionName": "Best Picture II: Lost In Translation / Traffic", "trackName": "Traffic", "collectionId": 419818699, "trackId": 299862577, "collectionViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/traffic/id299862577?uo=4", "trackCount": 2, "trackNumber": 2, "discNumber": 1, "collectionPrice": 9.99, "trackCensoredName": "Traffic", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/traffic/id299862577?uo=4", "trackTimeMillis": 8849855.0, "longDescription": "It's the high-stakes, high-risk world of the drug trade as seen through a well-blended mix of interrelated stories: a Mexican policeman (Benicio Del Toro) finds himself and his partner caught in an often deadly web of corruption; a pair of DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) work undercover in a sordid and dangerous part of San Diego; a wealthy drug baron living in upscale, suburban America is arrested and learns how quickly his unknowing and pampered wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) takes over his business; and the U.S. President's new drug czar (Michael Douglas) must deal with his increasingly drug-addicted teenage daughter.", "primaryGenreName": "Drama", "kind": "feature-movie", "country": "USA", "wrapperType": "track", "artworkUrl100": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/022/Video/90/9e/9c/mzi.zwiinsky.100x100-75.jpg", "collectionCensoredName": "Best Picture II: Lost In Translation / Traffic", "artistName": "Steven Soderbergh", "artworkUrl60": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/022/Video/90/9e/9c/mzi.zwiinsky.60x60-50.jpg", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "artworkUrl30": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/022/Video/90/9e/9c/mzi.zwiinsky.30x30-50.jpg"}, {"contentAdvisoryRating": "R", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "releaseDate": "2001-04-03T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "previewUrl": "http://a269.v.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/003/Video/2b/4f/f5/mzm.hsaikegu..640x480.h264lc.d2.p.m4v", "trackPrice": 9.99, "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/lost-in-america/id278236645?uo=4", "trackId": 278236645, "primaryGenreName": "Comedy", "collectionPrice": 9.99, "trackCensoredName": "Lost In America", "trackName": "Lost In America", "trackTimeMillis": 5480355.0, "longDescription": "Two yuppies drop out of the rat race and take to the road in a motor-home to do all the things they dreamed about in their youth.

The film, which was widely circulated among the armed services during World War II, was cut 22 minutes after its initial release in 1937 to reflect the wartime perception of the Chinese and to tone down the film's pacifism. Film historian Robert Gitt conducted nearly 13 years of detective work tracking down the lost footage. With extraordinary art direction, the set of Shangri-La is considered the largest ever built in Hollywood, winning designer Stephan Goosson an Academy Award\u00ae (Lost Horizon won two 1937 Academy Awards\u00ae: Art Direction-Set Design and Film Editing). Furthermore, the budget for the picture was staggering and cost almost four times the amount of any Columbia film at the time; an equivalent cost of approximately $30-$40 million today.

The premise was ultra-simple. Three pairs of contestants were abandoned, blindfolded, somewhere in the world armed only with a meagre amount of possessions and a limited ration of local currency. They'd no idea where they'd been taken, and were deliberately deposited in as desolate, inhospitable and lonely environment as possible. They then had to get back to London as quickly as possible, and the first team home won a bottle of champagne - plus the chance to do it all again next week.\r\n\r\nVarious elements combined to make the participants' respective journeys hugely enjoyable television. There was our sometimes gruesomely intimate insight into the relationships between team members, as they worked with but often against each other and squabbled constantly over how to make progress. The isolation aspect was intensely tangible. Aside from just one solitary cameraman - who themselves often became part of the drama - each pair were utterly alone, and you really felt it. Then there was the fact it was a desperately tense race against time. For every nonchalant easy-going contestant there was another absolutely determined to win at all costs. Finally Lost showcased a hilariously haphazard style of globetrotting, involving chaotic hitching and hiking across whole continents to the utter bemusement of their inhabitants. A potent mix of fly-on-the-wall showmanship and epic adventure, Lost was an exceptional show unfairly tucked away late at night that always managed to impress and excite.</Overview>\n<FirstAired>2007-09-27</FirstAired>\n<id>80595</id>\n</Series>\n<Series>\n<seriesid>73831</seriesid>\n<language>en</language>\n<SeriesName>Lost Treasures of NFL Films</SeriesName>\n<banner>graphical/73831-g.jpg</banner>\n<Overview>Since 1962, Steve Sabol has been an employee of NFL Films as a cameraman, an editor, a producer, and now its president.  It made him think he knew everything NFL Films had ever shot, but co-worker Phil Tuckett's discovery of an unused film negative, led to the creation of this series.  Two years of searching the film vaults has turned up thousands of feet of unseen film footage. Steve Sabol, the host of Lost Treasures of NFL Films, foolishly thought he could produce one 60-minute documentary covering the whole history of NFL Films.  In fact, enough material was unearthed to cover five programs, all on the 1960s.  And it just expanded from there.  In addition to the five-part reflection of NFL Films' beginnings in the 1960s, Lost Treasures of NFL Films unearthed footage of minor-league football, TV football analysts, training camps, and much more.

In 1913, young Richard Herncastle, played by Colin Firth, escapes from a stuffy, provincial English background into the glitter and excitement of the theatre world.

The mystery of illusions, on and off the stage, is eventually shattered for Richard, whose dream of becoming a famous painter becomes sidetracked while he contends with men gone nearly insane, the lusts of countless women, and a murder that hangs over his head.</Overview>\n<FirstAired>1986-10-24</FirstAired>\n<IMDB_ID>tt0090476</IMDB_ID>\n<id>250364</id>\n</Series>\n<Series>\n<seriesid>194571</seriesid>\n<language>en</language>\n<SeriesName>Lost Gardens</SeriesName>\n<Overview>Step back in time to discover eight forgotten and overgrown gardens, recreating them to resemble what they would've been in their heyday.\r\n\r\nRenowned British garden presenter Monty Don leads a horticultural and design team to ressurect eight very different British gardens, spanning 500 years.\r\n\r\nThey include a 19th century Warwick grocer's detached pleasure garden, a Tudor country pleasance and a piece of Edwardian Japanese pastiche.</Overview>\n<id>194571</id>\n</Series>\n<Series>\n<seriesid>189461</seriesid>\n<language>en</language>\n<SeriesName>Lost Worlds Vanished Lives ***Duplicate 79616***</SeriesName>\n<banner>graphical/189461-g.jpg</banner>\n<Overview>The study of rocks and their ancient secrets was something of a boyhood passion for David Attenborough.

It also suggests that this man still has great relevance today. Most of us don't know, that many things we take for granted in everyday life were introduced by Napoleon. From the metric system to massive road construction projects, from the shape of the young United States to the roots of modern European legislation Napoleon's achievements live on. \r\n\r\nLife Under Napoleon shows Napoleon's rise and fall exclusively from the point of view of the citizens of his time, including blacksmiths, soldiers, farmers, dissidents and housewives. In four episodes, we examine what life was like in Europe from 1799 until 1815, from the end of the French Revolution until Napoleon's defeat at Leipzig 1813 and Waterloo 1815, while keeping a global perspective in mind. \r\n\r\nThe central parts of each episode are first hand accounts of life changing events, based on authentic historical material, often surprising anecdotes that happened under Napoleon's reign. Our sources are diaries, letters and court documents. These don't speak of politics and alliances but about blood and tears, tyranny and hunger, about joy and freedom, and so does Life under Napoleon.</Overview>\n<id>260506</id>\n</Series>\n<Series>\n<seriesid>260768</seriesid>\n<language>en</language>\n<SeriesName>Lost and Found Video Night</SeriesName>\n<banner>graphical/260768-g.jpg</banner>\n<id>260768</id>\n</Series>\n<Series>\n<seriesid>109501</seriesid>\n<language>en</language>\n<SeriesName>Lost Treasures Of The Ancient World</SeriesName>\n<banner>graphical/109501-g.jpg</banner>\n<Overview>The unique Lost Treasures series enables the ancient wonders of the world to be seen as never before... magically \u2018restored\u2019 to their former glory by 3D graphics and presented in a superb animated format.

Waldemar Januszczak thinks so. In this documentary, Januszczak argues that the little known 17th-century portrait painter William Dobson was the first English painter of genius.\r\nDobson's life and times are embedded in one of the most turbulent and significant epochs of British history - the English Civil War. As official court painter to Charles I, the tragic British king later beheaded by parliament, Dobson had a ringside seat to an period of intense drama and conflict. Based in Oxford, where the court was transferred after parliament took control of London, Dobson produced an astonishing number of high quality portraits of royalist supporters, heroes and cavaliers which Januszczak believes are the first true examples of British art. As he puts it in the film: 'Dobson's face should be on our banknotes. His name should be on all our lips.'\r\nThe film investigates the few known facts about William Dobson and seeks out the personal stories he left behind as it follows him through his tragically short career. When he died in 1646 - penniless, unemployed and a drunk - Dobson was just 36.\r\nAmong the Dobson fans interviewed in the film is Earl Spencer, brother of Princess Diana, who agrees wholeheartedly that William Dobson was the first great British painter.</Overview>\n<FirstAired>2011-09-22</FirstAired>\n<id>252113</id>\n</Series>\n<Series>\n<seriesid>191901</seriesid>\n<language>en</language>\n<SeriesName>The Lost City</SeriesName>\n<banner>graphical/191901-g2.jpg</banner>\n<Overview>A 1935 Serial.

From Land's End to Scotland's John O'Groats, and with his new and modern filming technique, that for once has the ability to film in colour. For the first time the people of England, and the world could see itself in colour. This modern-day retrospective looks back, and takes the same ride some eighty years later, reconnecting with past places and past memories. With its compare and contrast travelogue flavour, Dan Cruickshank, the British Film Institute and the BBC have revisited a journey of how we used to live and how, as a nation, have changed, since those glorious days of England's golden years. Wonderful colourful historical vision with its updated look into the past.</Overview>\n<FirstAired>2006-04-18</FirstAired>\n<IMDB_ID>tt0804421</IMDB_ID>\n<id>144161</id>\n</Series>\n<Series>\n<seriesid>90471</seriesid>\n<language>en</language>\n<SeriesName>The Lost Islands</SeriesName>\n<banner>graphical/90471-g2.jpg</banner>\n<Overview>A hurricane nearly sinks the United World, a ship holding 40 teenagers from all around the world. Most of them flee the ship in lifeboats, however the evacuating children are not counted and five are left behind. The storm blows the battered sailing ship across a reef into the lagoon of an island.\r\n\r\nThe island, Tambu, ruled by a supposedly 200 year old immortal tyrant called \"Q\", who came to the island on one of several ships originally bound for New Holland. In the center of the island is a valley in which the descendants of the original ship still live, in the manner of an 18th century colonial community. Adjacent to Tambu is a smaller island, Malo, which is a barren wasteland. It is noteworthy because of a lagoon where prisoners are forced to dive for a \"blue weed\" which, according to the people of Tambu, is refined into a powder which the Q uses to extend his life.\r\n\r\nThe children befriend a local family, the Quinns, who help them remain hidden on the island in a swamp avoided by locals because it is, according to local myth, inhabited by the ghosts of the dead. Most of the episode storylines pit the children against the Q, who fears their knowledge of the outside world is a threat to his dominion of Tambu.</Overview>\n<id>90471</id>\n</Series>\n<Series>\n<seriesid>248282</seriesid>\n<language>en</language>\n<SeriesName>The Robinsons: Lost in Space</SeriesName>\n<IMDB_ID>tt0777269</IMDB_ID>\n<id>248282</id>\n</Series>\n<Series>\n<seriesid>261131</seriesid>\n<language>en</language>\n<SeriesName>America's Lost Treasures</SeriesName>\n<Overview>Across America, in basements and barns, attics and backyards, there are forgotten links to our national history.

The scenes are authentic. The color is real.\r\n\r\nIn the 1980s determined researchers began scouring the world for color film shot during World War II, and the result of their quest is spectacular. Seeing the war through the ubiquitous black-and-white footage has always made the experience somewhat distant, but in clear, crisp color, the enormity of the war and its horrors is startling and dramatic. Films of Nazi rallies are all the more disturbing; a viewer seeing the scene in color realizes the massive crowds saluting Hitler are no longer gray and faceless masses, but gatherings of well- dressed civilians. Color combat footage, from across Europe and the Pacific, is frighteningly immediate, and some of it, showing the wounded, the dead, and even prisoners being executed, will no doubt be disturbing for many viewers. Violence and destruction on an unimaginable scale is vividly put on display, as are smaller moments of soldiers smiling for the camera or liberated prisoners from the concentration camps staring in pained bewilderment. The episodes, produced by the History Channel, are introduced by veteran journalist Roger Mudd, and the narration for each individual segment typically contains excerpts from letters and diaries describing events close to those depicted in the film footage. The footage used is of a surprisingly high quality (much of it was shot and stored away, virtually unseen for decades), and it provides a stunning look at how the war appeared to those fighting it.</Overview>\n<FirstAired>2000-07-05</FirstAired>\n<IMDB_ID>tt0275779</IMDB_ID>\n<id>82250</id>\n</Series>\n<Series>\n<seriesid>73162</seriesid>\n<language>en</language>\n<SeriesName>The Secret Of Lost Creek</SeriesName>\n<banner>graphical/73162-g.jpg</banner>\n<FirstAired>1992-02-01</FirstAired>\n<id>73162</id>\n</Series>\n<Series>\n<seriesid>73549</seriesid>\n<language>en</language>\n<SeriesName>The Lost Saucer</SeriesName>\n<banner>graphical/73549-g.jpg</banner>\n<Overview>Jim Neighbors and Ruth Buzzi play two cornball alien robots that befriend two children who have stowed aboard their UFO.

Each episode is divided into three different segments concerning a different \"lost\" item or artifact from history. Most of the time, the three segments do not relate. Each segment runs around 7 minutes and in this time we learn the history, of several famous lost artifacts such as the flags from the Battle of Iwo Jima, and other not so famous artifacts like the first TV Dinner tray. Some segments were reused in other episodes. Episodes of the show were released on VHS in 2001 and the first episode has been released on DVD. 2000 was the big year for the series as most of the episodes were created and aired during that year, but a few new episodes aired 4 years later in 2004.\r\n\r\n</Overview>\n<FirstAired>1999-08-07</FirstAired>\n<id>83333</id>\n</Series>\n<Series>\n<seriesid>202111</seriesid>\n<language>en</language>\n<SeriesName>Quest For The Lost Civilisation</SeriesName>\n<Overview>In this set of three videotapes, writer Graham Hancock traverses the world and explains his controversial theory that an ancient civilization, highly intelligent people who sailed the planet as early as 10,500 B.C., spread advanced astronomical knowledge and built ancient observatories. Skeptics may scoff, but Hancock earnestly points out similarities in giant stone structures in the Egyptian desert and Cambodian jungles, and on Easter Island and in Micronesia, he points out what he considers evidence of an ancient society of seafarers. His ideas may seem utterly bizarre at first, but Hancock presents them in an understated and good-natured manner, and he also makes clever use of computer graphics and aerial photography to illustrate the startling similarities in ancient structures found from the North Atlantic to the South Pacific. At times the three documentaries overlap, and at times they seem like one long program rather than three separate presentations. But throughout, Hancock raises some puzzling questions, and even if you don't buy his arguments, bolstered though they are by mathematical equations and astronomical diagrams, the Quest for the Lost Civilization is an entertaining mixture of archaeology, astronomy, and speculation.</Overview>\n<FirstAired>1998-10-31</FirstAired>\n<IMDB_ID>tt0252165</IMDB_ID>\n<id>202111</id>\n</Series>\n<Series>\n<seriesid>258293</seriesid>\n<language>en</language>\n<SeriesName>Seekers of the Lost Treasure</SeriesName>\n<banner>graphical/258293-g.jpg</banner>\n<Overview>Award-winning series following the stories of the world's greatest archaeological adventurers.

All are fascinating in their own right for what they tell us of lost tribes, lost cultures, even lost civilizations. But the real stories are rarely told--the blood-stirring adventures of the travelers who braved swamp fever, cannibals, sandstorms &amp; other perils to capture the treasures. Michael Rockefeller; Lord Elgin; Giovanni Belzoni; and Edward Thompson were all men of guile &amp; daring in the tradition of Indiana Jones. They travelled to the ends of the Earth in search of archeological riches of ancient and exotic cultures.

Bold colors, spectacular shooting locations, and less-ambiguous plots &amp; characters all combined to present an exciting new series. It aired on ITV in the UK in 1976-1977, CTV in Canada, CBS in the United States (in 1978/79) and TF1 in France (series 1 in 1976-1977 and series 2 in 1979).

Coupling gives us insight on modern romance and its often humorous consequences. \r\n\r\n\"When a couple gets together, it's never just the two of them - they also bring baggage - and Susan and Steve are no exception. Their baggage is a crowd of best friends and exes who talk about all aspects of sex and relationships on their never-ending quest to find true love. \r\n\r\n\"Susan is a beautiful go-getter with an uninhibited attitude who used to date Patrick, the sextet's charismatic, cocky player, Chicago's king of conquests - a guy who's just too cool to worry about being smart. Attractive Sally is a beauty therapist who is Susan's unashamedly vain best friend, who aggressively battles aging with heavy doses of moisturizer and men - including Patrick. \r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, Steve, while getting together with Susan, can't seem to shake loose from his vivacious and slightly vacuous ex-girlfriend Jane, a woman supremely confident in her ability to seduce anyone of either sex, and who refuses to be dumped unless she's the one doing the dumping. Jeff  is Steve's \"porn buddy\" who is, in equal parts, obsessed and bewildered by actual sex; charming in his way, but with an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the worst possible time. He works in the same office as Susan, with whom he had a disastrous and unsuccessful one-night fling.\" </Overview>\n<FirstAired>2003-09-25</FirstAired>\n<IMDB_ID>tt0338592</IMDB_ID>\n<id>70905</id>\n</Series>\n</Data>"}, {"func_name": "iTunes.method", "_id": -8841429447747698296, "expiration": {"$date": 1346948775843}, "value": {"resultCount": 0, "results": ["list"]}}, {"func_name": "iTunes.method", "_id": -5171037206021124496, "expiration": {"$date": 1346948776737}, "value": {"resultCount": 5, "results": ["list", {"contentAdvisoryRating": "R", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "releaseDate": "2009-08-01T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "previewUrl": "http://a720.v.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/045/Video/11/f2/13/mzm.gbmrqdcm..640x468.h264lc.d2.p.m4v", "trackPrice": 9.99, "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/dark-angel/id329765691?uo=4", "trackId": 329765691, "primaryGenreName": "Action & Adventure", "collectionPrice": 9.99, "trackCensoredName": "Dark Angel", "trackName": "Dark Angel", "trackTimeMillis": 5492409.0, "longDescription": "Jack Caine (Dolph Lundgren) is a cop who\u2019s taken it upon himself to end the Houston drugs trade and take out its notorious chief supplier.

Everyone can see them, everyone can talk to them -- but what happens when a kid outgrows his friend? Then that friend is welcome at Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, an adoption center owned by old Madame Foster, that provides a home for them, until a child in need of an imaginary friend, who can't think their own up, comes to adopt them.\r\n\r\nOne such friend there is Blooregard Q. Kazoo, the creation of eight-year-old clever, yet shy Mac, who's mother tells him he's too old for Bloo. Though the little blue blob felt that \"adoption is not an option,\" Mac convinced him to stay long enough that, after a sinister plan devised by self-centered Duchess and Mac's 13-year-old dumber than dirt bullying brother Terrence fails, Mac proves his loyalty. Moved by his loyalty and pure imagination, Madame Foster, herself, states that Bloo may stay at Foster's without ever having to worry about being adopted. In return, all Mac has to do is visit every day.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a problem, considering that Mac would rather spend his after-school time with Bloo and all the other wacky friends, like the egg-laying sanity challenged bird-airplane-plant thing Coco, cowardly protector Eduardo, basketball-playing Wilt, along with Madame Foster's granddaughter Frankie and the imaginary friend created by Madame Foster, Mr. Herriman, than at home. Every day, thanks to Blooregard's crazy schemes, the gang end up in wacky adventures.</Overview>\n<FirstAired>2004-08-13</FirstAired>\n<IMDB_ID>tt0419326</IMDB_ID>\n<zap2it_id>SH677262</zap2it_id>\n<id>79323</id>\n</Series>\n<Series>\n<seriesid>77971</seriesid>\n<language>en</language>\n<SeriesName>My Little Pony and Friends</SeriesName>\n<banner>text/77971.jpg</banner>\n<Overview>Welcome to the My Little Pony 'n Friends guide at TV Tome.

In this incarnation, the Little Ponies' adventures where divided into 15-minute segments and paired off with 15-minute episodes from a rotating block of other series  the Friends in the title.  The other series that filled out the half-hour were Glo Friends, Potato Head Kids, and Moondreamers.  Each of these shows had their own nifty toyline. My Little Pony revolved around the magic ponies whose peaceful existence in Dream Valley was threatened by nasty (but not scary) villains.  These earthling, unicorn, and pegasus ponies came in every conceivable color and had small pictures on their backs that indicated their names or personalities.

Friends like cousin Spooky, Wendy the Good Witch and Nightmare the Ghostly Horse, round out Casper's supporting cast.\r\nIn 1950, as Casper gained tremendous popularity, Paramount expanded the cartoons into an entire television series.

The second was a 4 1/2-minute short that featured the Wonder Twins from planet Exxor, alien teenage superheroes Zan and Jayna who utilize special changing powers by touching their fists to activate and spring into action to help kids and teenagers in danger. Helping them out is the blue space monkey Gleek , who has a long tail that comes in handy every now and then. The threesome were an effective replacement of original Junior SuperFriends Wendy, Marvin, and WonderDog. The third episode was the main, full-length episode of the hour as the SuperFriends and the Wonder Twins teamed up against various villains and dangers that usually were a threat to the world. These were at least 22 minutes long. The fourth episode was a rescue mission that teamed at least one of the regular superheroes with another DC Comics superhero. This guest cast included Hawkman and Hawkgirl, Green Lantern, Rima the jungle woman, the Atom and the Flash . Other heroes (not from DC Comics) created for this and subsequent SuperFriends series are Black Vulcan, Samurai , and Apache Chief for more ethnic variety. These shorts were 6 minutes long. In between episodes, there were a number of fun segments for kids. There were magic tricks, decoder games, arts and crafts to make objects out of household items, as well as the more serious health and safety tips.

Helping him in his quest is his friend Barney, a confirmed bachelor with endless, sometimes outrageous opinions, a penchant for suits and a foolproof way to meet women.

Wodehouse's Jeeves stories. It starred Hugh Laurie as Bertie Wooster, a jovial but empty-headed young gentleman, and Stephen Fry as Jeeves, his improbably well-informed and talented valet. The stories are set in England and the United States in the pre-World War II 20th century (there are aspects of the Edwardian era, 1920s, and 1930s). Wooster is a well-to-do bachelor, a minor aristocrat and member of the idle rich. He and his friends, who are mainly members of The Drones Club, are aided in all manner of societal adventures by the indispensable \"gentleman's personal gentleman,\" Jeeves. Wodehouse drew the themes of his plots, which concern the entangled love lifes of the major characters, from classical New Comedy.</Overview>\n<FirstAired>1990-04-01</FirstAired>\n<IMDB_ID>tt0098833</IMDB_ID>\n<id>76934</id>\n</Series>\n</Data>"}, {"func_name": "iTunes.method", "_id": 6864063921299657357, "expiration":

In lyrical, honest, angry, funny and tender language, Shange\u2019s \u201ccolored girls\u201d evoked the feelings woven into the fabric of black female life in America. Within two years, the play became a Broadway sensation, won an Obie and Tony Award, and would eventually be produced in regional theaters throughout the country. Now, thirty six years later, filmmaker Tyler Perry adapts this landmark work for the big screen, integrating the vivid language of Shange\u2019s poems into a contemporary narrative that explores what it means to be a woman of color - and a woman of any color - in this world. FOR COLORED GIRLS weaves together the stories of nine different women \u2013 Joanna, Tangie, Crystal, Gilda, Kelly, Juanita, Yasmine, Nyla and Alice \u2013 as they move into and out of one another\u2019s existences; some are well known to one another, others are as yet strangers. Crises, heartbreaks and crimes will ultimately bring these nine women fully into the same orbit where they will find commonality and understanding. Each will speak her truth as never before.

soldiers and their families. An intimate drama of love and betrayal, masters and slaves, and husbands and wives, it chronicles epic times that saw the fall of a republic and the creation of an empire. The series begins in 52 BC, as Gaius Julius Caesar has completed his masterful conquest of Gaul after eight years of war, and is preparing to return to Rome. He heads home with thousands of loyal battle-hardened men, huge amounts of loot in gold and slaves, and a populist agenda for radical social change. Terrified, the aristocracy threatens to prosecute Caesar for war crimes as soon as he sets foot in Rome. Caesar's old friend and mentor, Pompey Magnus, attempts to foment mutiny in order to maintain the balance of power. Two of Caesar's soldiers, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, thwart Pompey's plan and in the process, win the eternal gratitude of Caesar and the Julian clan, affording the two plebian officers an intimate view of the ruling class. The fates of Pullo and Vorenus become entwined with those of Caesar, Mark Antony, Cleopatra and the boy Octavian, a strange and awkward child who, by political guile and bloody force, will become the first emperor of Rome.</Overview>\n<FirstAired>2005-08-28</FirstAired>\n<IMDB_ID>tt0384766</IMDB_ID>\n<zap2it_id>SH762203</zap2it_id>\n<id>73508</id>\n</Series>\n<Series>\n<seriesid>81623</seriesid>\n<language>en</language>\n<SeriesName>Rome: Power &amp; Glory</SeriesName>\n<banner>graphical/81623-g.jpg</banner>\n<Overview>Travel back in time to one of the most glorious empires in history.

Made in the shadow of both Vietnam and Watergate, THE CRAZIES is a grim allegory about a government conspiracy against the public that ultimately results in genocide. The story is set in director George Romero's home state of Pennsylvania. In the film, a government plane carrying a dangerous virus crashes near the small town of Evans City. The virus finds its way into the town's drinking water, turning everyone who is exposed to it into a murderous lunatic. Firefighter David (Will McMillan) and his pregnant wife, Judy (Lane Carroll), remain unaffected but face great danger in trying to escape the town, which has been quarantined by the US army, whose members lurk around every corner, clad in gas masks and protective suits. The President is often depicted as a detached talking head, offering no hope to citizens trapped by the mistakes of his administration. Similar in tone and structure to his DEAD trilogy, Romero's film overcomes a visibly limited budget to create a colorful 1970s genre film that neatly captures the feeling of governmental distrust that was characteristic of the Vietnam era. With both a social message and plenty of splatter, THE CRAZIES is an underrated but appealing horror film.", "kind": "feature-movie", "country": "USA", "wrapperType": "track", "artworkUrl100": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/075/Video/cc/76/04/mzi.hfgjjqkw.100x100-75.jpg", "artistName": "George A.

A hero for our millennium. And not a moment too soon, because during the five years (much longer in movie-fan years!) Superman sought his home planet, things changed on his adopted planet. Nations moved on without him. Lois Lane now has a son, a fiance and a Pulitzer for \"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\" And Lex Luthor has a plan that will destroy millions - no, billions - of lives. Filmmaker Bryan Singer (X-Men) gives the world the Superman it needs, honoring the legend everyone loves while taking it in a powerful new direction.

Enjoy more footage of the Krypton Council, a glimpse of stars of prior Superman incarnations, more of Jor-El underscoring his son's purpose on Earth andan extended sequence inside Lex Luthor's gauntlet of doom.

However, instead of landing in rural Kansas and being raised to believe in American values, his rocket ship crashes into a Ukrainian farm. The young hero grows up in Russia and becomes the champion of the common worker, fighting on the side of socialism during Stalin's reign. What begins as one small shift in trajectory results in massive changes for the world, as the most powerful man alive no longer belongs to the United States of America.

In 1942, Fleischer Studios was dissolved and reorganized as Famous Studios, which produced the final eight shorts. These cartoons are seen as some of the finest, and certainly the most lavishly budgeted, animated cartoons produced during The Golden Age of American animation. In 1994, the series was voted #33 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field.\r\n\r\nBy mid-1941, brothers Max and Dave Fleischer had recently finished their first animated feature film, Gulliver's Travels, and were deep into production on their second, Mister Bug Goes to Town. They were reluctant to commit themselves to another major project at the time when they were approached by their distributor, and owner since May 1941, Paramount Pictures. Paramount was interested in cashing in on the phenomenal popularity of the new Superman comic books by producing a series of theatrical cartoons based upon the character. The Fleischers hoped to discourage Paramount from committing to the series, so they informed the studio that the cost of producing such a series of cartoons would be about $100,000 per short -- an amazingly high figure, about six times the typical budget of a six-minute Fleischer Popeye the Sailor cartoon during the 1940s.[1] To their surprise, Paramount agreed to a budget of $50,000[2] - half the requested sum, but still three times the cost of the average Fleischer short - , and the Fleischers were committed to the project.\r\n\r\nThe first cartoon in the series, simply titled Superman, was released on September 26, 1941, and was nominated for the 1942 Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons. It lost to Lend a Paw, a Pluto cartoon from Walt Disney Productions and RKO Pictures.\r\n\r\nThe Fleischers produced nine cartoons in the Superman series before Paramount took over the Fleischer Studios facility in Miami and ousted Max and Dave Fleischer, due to the fact that the brothers were no longer able to cooperate with each other, and the studio's co-owner Dave Fleischer had left Florida to produce Screen Gems cartoons for Columbia Pictures in California as well. The sleek look of the series continued, but there was a noticeable change in the storylines of the later shorts of the series. The first nine cartoons had more of a science fiction aspect to them, as they involved the Man of Steel fighting robots, giant dinosaurs, meteors from outer space, and other perils. The later eight cartoons in the series dealt more with World War II propaganda stories, such as in Eleventh Hour, which finds Superman going to Japan to commit acts of espionage in order to reduce the morale of the enemy.\r\n\r\nRotoscoping, the process of tracing animation drawings from live-action footage, was used extensively to lend realism to the human characters and Superman. Many of Superman's actions, however, could not be rotoscoped (flying, lifting very large objects, and so on). In these cases, the Fleischer lead animators, many of whom were not trained in figure drawing, animated roughly and depended upon their assistants, many of whom were inexperienced with animation but were trained in figure drawing, to keep Superman \"on model\" during his action sequences.\r\n\r\nThe first seven cartoons originated the classic opening line which was later adopted by the Superman radio series and in the live-action television series a decade later: \"Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound!\" However, for the final two of the first nine Fleischer-produced cartoons and first of the eight Famous Studios-produced cartoons, the opening was changed to \"Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to soar higher than any plane!\". With the changeover to Famous Studios and the loss of the Fleischers, the opening line of the cartoon series was changed to \"Faster than a streak of lightning! More powerful than the pounding surf! Mightier than a roaring hurricane!\" This series also continued (from the radio series) the use of the now-classic exclamation: \"Up in the sky, look! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman!\"\r\n\r\nFamous Studios ended the series after a total of seventeen shorts had been produced, replacing it with a series of shorts based upon Marge's Little Lulu. The high cost of the series kept it from continuing in the face of budgetary restrictions that were imposed after removing the Fleischers from the studio. The first cartoon had a budget of $50,000 (equivalent to $1,316,000 today), and the other sixteen each had a budget of $30,000 (equivalent to $789,600 for each of the eight other Fleischer cartoons and $731,111.10 for each of the eight Famous Studios cartoons), bringing the total cost of the series to $530,000 (equivalent to $13,481,688.80 today).[2] In addition, Paramount cited waning interest in the Superman shorts among theater exhibitors as another justification for the series' cancellation.[4]\r\n\r\nAll seventeen cartoons were sold to Motion Pictures for Television (producers of the TV series The Adventures of Superman) in 1955, and all eventually fell into the public domain (their copyrights having not been renewed by either Paramount, NTA/Republic, EMKA, Ltd./Universal Studios, or even Motion Pictures for Television and DC Comics), and have been widely distributed on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD. Nonetheless, Warner Bros., via parent Time Warner's ownership of DC Comics, now owns the original film elements to the cartoons.\r\n\r\nThe voice of Superman for the series was initially provided by Bud Collyer, who also performed the lead character's voice during the Superman radio series. Joan Alexander was the voice of Lois Lane, a role she also portrayed on radio alongside Collyer. Music for the series was composed by Sammy Timberg, the Fleischers' long-time musical collaborator.\r\n\r\nA 1944 Famous Studios Popeye the Sailor cartoon entitled She-Sick Sailors parodied the Superman cartoons, two years after production on the cartoons had ceased. In this cartoon, Popeye's enemy Bluto dresses up as Superman to fool Olive Oyl, and he challenges Popeye to feats of super-strength that \"only Superman\" can do. The musical score for She-Sick Sailors includes echoes of Sammy Timberg's Fleischer/Famous Superman score.\r\n\r\nIn a rare move for a competing studio, Leon Schlesinger Productions, producers of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies (which were distributed by WB), featured Timberg's Superman theme in Snafuperman, a 1944 Private Snafu cartoon Schlesinger produced for the U.S. Army.\r\n\r\nThe Fleischer cartoons were also responsible for Superman being able to fly. When they started work on the series, Superman could only leap from place to place (hence \"Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound\" in the opening). But they deemed it as \"silly looking\" after seeing it animated and decided to have him fly instead.</Overview>\n<FirstAired>1941-09-26</FirstAired>\n<IMDB_ID>tt0034247</IMDB_ID>\n<id>102621</id>\n</Series>\n<Series>\n<seriesid>72468</seriesid>\n<language>en</language>\n<SeriesName>Lois &amp; Clark - The New Adventures of Superman</SeriesName>\n<banner>graphical/72468-g2.jpg</banner>\n<Overview>A much more lavish version of the popular Superman television series which had first aired forty years earlier, Lois &amp; Clark focused more on the Man of Steel's early adult years in Metropolis.

Enterprise. The show began with the production of the 1964 pilot \"The Cage\". \"The Cage\" featured Jeffrey Hunter as Enterprise captain Christopher Pike. The pilot was rejected by NBC executives as being too cerebral. In order to demonstrate the action-adventure potential of the series, another pilot entitled \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\" was produced. Replacing Jeffrey Hunter as Enterprise captain was William Shatner who starred as Captain James T. Kirk. The new pilot also starred Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock who was the only character to return from the original pilot after NBC's rejection of \"The Cage\". Response to the second, action-oriented, pilot was good and NBC gave the go ahead to the series. \r\n\r\nThe series premiered on NBC on Thursday, September 8, 1966 in the 8:30-9:30 PM timeslot with the episode \"The Man Trap\". Critical response to the series was mixed and rating were lower than expected. In its second season, reoccurring guest star DeForest Kelley was added to the series' starring cast and the show was moved to Friday at 8:30. A decline in the ratings, however, prompted NBC to attempt to cancel the series after its second season, but a letter writing campaign by die hard fans of the show saved it from cancellation. An additional season of episodes were produced, but ratings continued to decline most likely due to the quality of the third season episodes and a bad 10:00 PM Friday night time slot. Despite another letter writing campaign, the series was finally cancelled after its third season. The last new episode \"Turnabout Intruder\" was shown on June 3, 1969. \r\n\r\nAfter its three year run Star Trek began running syndication where it was discovered by legion of new fans and became a phenomenon. The show inspired six features films, an animated series, and four additional spin-off television shows. Other spin-off's include novels, comic books, merchandise and an enormous amount of fan-fiction based on the series. Despite its short network run, Star Trek has become one of the most successful shows in television history. \r\n\r\nAside from its three main stars, Star Trek featured a large cast of reoccurring guest stars that includes James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, Walter Koenig, Majel Barrett, and Grace Lee Whitney. Other notable guest stars include Diana Muldaur, Gary Lockwood, Ricardo Montalban, Sally Kellerman, Julie Newmar, Frank Gorshin, John Colicos, Roger C. Carmel, William Campbell, Ted Cassidy, Michael Ansara and Elisha Cook, Jr. Notable writers for the series include Gene Roddenberry, Gene L.

This show basically continues the adventures of the original series (presumably in the fourth year of the five-year mission), but takes advantage of the unlimited special effects provided by animation to introduce more alien crewmen (the felinoid M'Ress and the tripedal Arex) as well as introduce more elaborate adventures like an underwater adventure, the miniaturization of the crew to 1 cm., and the appearance of a giant fire-breathing two-headed dragon. The show is currently not considered \"canon\" by Paramount and the folks associated with the various subsequent TV shows. However, elements of the animated series have been used in subsequent shows (Sarek refers to the events of \"Yesteryear\" in TNG's \"Reunification Pt. 1\") and the Enterprise-D's holodeck seems to have been in part inspired by the holodeck we see in \"Practical Joker\".

By invitation of the provisional Bajoran government, Starfleet stepped in to oversee the rebuilding and day-to-day operations of the newly christened Deep Space Nine.

Although fan films have been produced for almost as long as there have been film fans, they were generally few and far between before the advent of home video. Produced on digital video, the show's sets are almost completely virtual, using a green-screen chroma keyed process to place performers into virtual settings.\r\n\r\nThe series is set during the era of the Star Trek: The Next Generation series. Episodes revolve around the starship USS Excelsior, and its home base, Deep Space 12, which is located in the Briar Patch, a region of space introduced in the film Star Trek: Insurrection.</Overview>\n<FirstAired>2000-01-01</FirstAired>\n<id>126401</id>\n</Series>\n</Data>"}, {"func_name": "iTunes.method", "_id": 3317774131043365887, "expiration": {"$date": 1346948818582}, "value": {"resultCount": 0, "results": ["list"]}}, {"func_name": "TMDB.__tmdb", "_id": -9142074737244659324, "expiration": {"$date": 1346948818582}, "value": {"total_results": 1, "total_pages": 1, "page": 1, "results": ["list", {"poster_path": "/7VKpj4Xl3hTzgAS3xpVuOyqNnSv.jpg", "title": "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan", "release_date": "1982-06-04", "popularity": 50.941, "original_title": "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan", "backdrop_path": "/gih4L6m9u1yB3PGwyJxB5wjzbqR.jpg", "vote_count": 28, "adult": false, "vote_average": 8.3, "id": 154}]}}, {"func_name": "TheTVDB.searchRaw", "_id": 3728845415529368575, "expiration": {"$date": 1346948818582}, "value": "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n<Data>\n</Data>"}, {"func_name": "iTunes.method", "_id": 3615192149700666993, "expiration": {"$date": 1346948818583}, "value": {"resultCount": 2, "results": ["list", {"contentAdvisoryRating": "PG", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "releaseDate": "1982-06-04T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "previewUrl": "http://a1950.v.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/039/Video/ed/66/d3/mzm.vavuseot..640x478.h264lc.d2.p.m4v", "trackPrice": 9.99, "discCount": 1, "collectionName": "Star Trek II, III & IV", "trackName": "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan", "collectionId": 343644532, "trackId": 208510932, "collectionViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/star-trek-ii-the-wrath-of-khan/id208510932?uo=4", "trackCount": 3, "trackNumber": 1, "discNumber": 1, "collectionPrice": 14.99, "trackCensoredName": "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/star-trek-ii-the-wrath-of-khan/id208510932?uo=4", "trackTimeMillis": 6780447.0, "longDescription": "It is the 23rd century.

Taunted by the yakuza, they live in constant fear of being discovered and repatriated. Into this perilous world ventures Steelhead (Chan), a humble tractor repairman who has traveled to Tokyo in search of his missing girlfriend, Xiu Xiu (Xu Jinglei), who vanished into thin air shortly after arriving in the city. It doesn't take Steelhead long to learn just what kind of hardships Chinese immigrants in Japan endure at the hands of underworld gangsters and foreign crime syndicates, and upon discovering that Xiu Xiu has adapted a Japanese identity and married up-and-coming yakuza chief Eguichi (Masaya Kato), the two men form an uneasy alliance. Over time, Steelhead earns the respect of his fellow Chinese immigrants by establishing a place for them to gather. But the dark side still beckons to Steelhead, because after helping Eguichi dispense with a powerful rival, he is granted full control of Shinjuku's most popular nightspots. Resistant to the allure of the criminal lifestyle, Steelhead discovers a new love and opens a tractor repair business just outside the city. When Equichi begins using Steelhead's former compatriots as pawns to front the yakuza's drug trade, the vengeful immigrant returns to the city determined to exact justice, even if it means destroying the future of the woman he once loved.", "kind": "feature-movie", "country": "USA", "wrapperType": "track", "artworkUrl100": "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/003/Video/ff/d0/1c/mzi.jflvceyi.100x100-75.jpg", "artistName": "Tung-Shing Yee", "artworkUrl60": "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/003/Video/ff/d0/1c/mzi.jflvceyi.60x60-50.jpg", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "artworkUrl30": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/003/Video/ff/d0/1c/mzi.jflvceyi.30x30-50.jpg"}, {"contentAdvisoryRating": "Unrated", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "releaseDate": "2001-06-23T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "previewUrl": "http://a173.v.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Video/db/e7/63/mzm.kwyzmqnq..640x476.h264lc.d2.p.m4v", "trackPrice": 9.99, "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/perfect-education-40-days/id411415252?uo=4", "trackId": 411415252, "primaryGenreName": "Drama", "collectionPrice": 9.99, "trackCensoredName": "Perfect Education: 40 Days of Love", "trackName": "Perfect Education: 40 Days of Love", "trackTimeMillis": 5334751.0, "longDescription": "Akai, a psychologist, is approached by Haruka, a beautiful but morose young woman seeking help for her depression.

Patrick Macnee reprises his role of John Steed of The Avengers (1961-69) but this time with two new partners, Mike Gambit (Gareth Hunt) and Purdey (Joanna Lumley). Like its predecessor, the series often featured fantastical plots with diabolical masterminds as villains, but this new version infused the franchise with a thrilling new feel.  Bold colors, spectacular shooting locations, and less-ambiguous plots &amp; characters all combined to present an exciting new series. It aired on ITV in the UK in 1976-1977, CTV in Canada, CBS in the United States (in 1978/79) and TF1 in France (series 1 in 1976-1977 and series 2 in 1979). The final four episodes were almost completely produced by Canadian interests and were filmed there. In some markets they carried the title The New Avengers in Canada.</Overview>\n<FirstAired>1976-10-01</FirstAired>\n<IMDB_ID>tt0074031</IMDB_ID>\n<id>76360</id>\n</Series>\n</Data>"}, {"func_name": "iTunes.method", "_id": 3765647664326759239, "expiration": {"$date": 1346948824817}, "value": {"resultCount": 13, "results": ["list", {"trackCensoredName": "The Avengers", "contentAdvisoryRating": "PG-13", "kind": "feature-movie", "trackName": "The Avengers", "trackId": 533654020, "wrapperType": "track", "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-avengers/id533654020?uo=4", "artworkUrl100": "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/088/Video/v4/88/cf/0b/88cf0b0f-4c4b-fbda-c4a3-f15ec5392e25/mza_5059262374444342889.100x100-75.jpg", "longDescription": "Marvel presents Marvel's The Avengers, the Super Hero team-up of a lifetime.

The Simpson family first appeared on television as the subjects of interstitial \"shorts\" on The Tracey Ullman Show in April of 1987. The Simpsons remained a staple on The Tracey Ullman Show for three seasons until they premiered in their own half-hour series, on December 17, 1989. With the help of Jim Brooks and Sam Simon, Matt Groening's cartoon family turned into an instant success.\r\n\r\nSet in Springfield, the average American town, the show focuses on the antics and everyday adventures of the Simpson family; Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie, as well as a virtual cast of thousands. Since the beginning, the series has been a pop culture icon, attracting hundreds of celebrities to guest star. The show has also made name for itself in its fearless satirical take on politics, media and American life in general.\r\n\r\nCurrently in its 23st season, The Simpsons has piled up close to 500 episodes, 27 Emmy Awards, a handful of music albums, countless endorsements and merchandise, and even made the jump to the silver screen in the summer of 2007 with The Simpsons Movie.

Jessica, along with her two best friends, Ken Paves and CaCee Cobb, are traveling the globe to explore how different cultures define beauty and the extraordinary lengths that women will go to in order to achieve it. \r\n\r\nJourneying from Tokyo and Thailand, to Paris and Rio, to Uganda, Morocco and India -- the cast is met in each city by a \"beauty ambassador\" who helps them tackle topics revolving around fashion, fitness, diet and outlandish spa treatments. In each country, Jessica, Ken and CaCee experience firsthand some of the local beauty rituals, from drinking cow urine in India, to being buried up to their necks in Tokyo, to drinking gourds of ghee in a fattening hut in Uganda. But it's not all fun and games -- Jessica also explores the high price that some women pay to feel beautiful. Imagine the plight of women in Northern Thailand, who wear 20-pound rings around their necks, crushing their clavicles, to a mother in Rio who cannot afford electricity, but is secretly saving for butt implants. \r\n\r\nEach episode ends in a complete transformation of the cast. Imagine Jessica, Ken and CaCee dressed in ornate kaftans, or camel-back riding to a festive Moroccan party complete with belly dancers and live musicians. \r\n\r\nAs Jessica learns how beauty is defined across the globe, and how she \"measures up,\" and her own definition of the word, she is challenged to redefine it along the way, allowing the audience to see a personal, vulnerable and oftentimes hilarious side of Jessica Simpson. \r\n\r\nEach episode culminates in a complete transformation of the cast -- Imagine Jessica, Ken and CaCee dressed in ornate kaftans, riding camel-back to a festive Moroccan party, complete with belly dancers and live musicians.

Today, it is a vivid, dramatic and pervasive presence in all our lives. It is the dominant institution of our time. A complex, sobering, yet darkly amusing documentary, The Corporation takes its audience on a graphic and engaging quest to reveal the corporation's inner workings, curious history, controversial impacts and possible futures. Mark Achbar, co-director of the influential and inventive Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media, teams up with co-director Jennifer Abbott and writer Joel Bakan to examine the far-reaching repercussions of the corporation's ascent. Based on Bakan's best-selling book, \"The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power\", the film has achieved international critical and box office success. Winner of 10 audience awards, including Sundance, and 26 awards in total from prestigious festivals around the world, it stands as the top-grossing Canadian feature documentary of all time. The Corporation includes encounters and interviews with CEOs and top-level executives from a range of industries: energy, pharmaceutical, computer, tire, carpet, sporting goods, public relations, branding, news, advertising, and undercover marketing, as well as the first management guru, the first corporate-sponsored university students, a Nobel-prize winning economist, a corporate spy, and a range of academics, critics, historians and thinkers. The Corporation reveals that legally, a corporation is granted the status of a \"person\", and asks: \"If that's the case, what kind of person is it?\" To assess the \"personality\" of the corporate \"person,\" a checklist is employed, using diagnostic criteria of the World Health Organization and the DSM IV, the standard diagnostic tool of psychiatrists and psychologists. It turns out the operational principles of the corporation give it a highly anti-social \"personality\": it is self-interested, inherently amoral, callous and deceitful; it breaches social and legal standards to get its way; it does not suffer from guilt, yet it can mimic the human qualities of empathy, caring and altruism. A disturbing diagnosis is delivered: the institutional embodiment of laissez-faire capitalism meets the diagnostic criteria of a psychopath. The Corporation depicts numerous, inspiring, corporate harm reduction strategies employed by individuals and organizations working to regulate, re-write and reform this formidable societal force.", "kind": "feature-movie", "country": "USA", "wrapperType": "track", "artworkUrl100": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/008/Video/17/c3/3e/mzi.mkeuobiw.100x100-75.jpg", "artistName": "Mark Achbar & Jennifer Abbott", "artworkUrl60": "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/008/Video/17/c3/3e/mzi.mkeuobiw.60x60-50.jpg", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "artworkUrl30": "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/008/Video/17/c3/3e/mzi.mkeuobiw.30x30-50.jpg"}, {"contentAdvisoryRating": "Unrated", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "releaseDate": "2010-10-10T07:00:00Z", "currency": "USD", "previewUrl": "http://a1156.v.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/031/Video/1c/88/27/mzm.phowhnmj..640x480.h264lc.d2.p.m4v", "trackPrice": 9.99, "trackViewUrl": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/clear-lake-wi/id411228284?uo=4", "trackId": 411228284, "primaryGenreName": "Thriller", "collectionPrice": 9.99, "trackCensoredName": "Clear Lake, WI", "trackName": "Clear Lake, WI", "trackTimeMillis": 5050592.0, "longDescription": "In 1994, residents of the small town of Clear Lake, WI fell victim to a strange and horrible disease.

So what happens when you throw a new baby into it?\r\n\r\nReagan (Christina Applegate) and her husband, Chris (Will Arnett), are the proud new parents of baby Amy. She may have been unexpected, but life's curve balls can be a godsend, literally. Unless you have a career that needs attention, which is exactly what Reagan has. So, bucking tradition, they decide Reagan's the one going back to work while Chris is going to be the stay-at-home dad. Easy, right?

Lois Lane now has a son, a fiance and a Pulitzer for \"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\" And Lex Luthor has a plan that will destroy millions - no, billions - of lives. Filmmaker Bryan Singer (X-Men) gives the world the Superman it needs, honoring the legend everyone loves while taking it in a powerful new direction. Brandon Routh proves a perfect choice to wear the hero's cape, leading a top cast that includes Kate Bosworth as Lois and Kevin Spacey as Lex.
