		    Liking a Stamp: +2 points (Removing a like: -2) <br>
		    Adding a Todo: +2 (Removing: -2) <br>
            Adding a comment: +3 (Removing: -3) <br>
            Adding a friend: +3 (Removing: -3) <br>
			Taking an entity-based action: +2 <br>
			Adding a stamp: +5 (Removing: -5) <br>
            Inviting a new User: +5 </p>
        
        <p>Based on these scores a User is classified into one of the following four user groups: <br>

           Dormant User: 0 or less points in a week/month </p>
