Use of '_NAME' convention with psuedo-private attributes:
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
It is my understanding that single leading underscores are to be
used with module fields that are not meant to be imported.
Double leading underscores are to be used for psuedo-private
attributes because they trigger class-based name mangling,
such that __foo in class Bar is automatically translated to
_Bar__foo, which in turn helps to prevent namespace collisions.
To the best of my knowledge single-leading underscores do not
trigger a similar behavior when used in class definitions.
It seems that the single-underscore convention is used deliberately
in many cases for 'protected' attributes, but it seems in other
places that it is just used for what are arguably private attributes.
I would personally suggest that we move away from 'protected' or accidental
single-underscore attributes, refactoring 'protected' use where necessary.
