Use of '_NAME' convention with psuedo-private attributes:
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
It is my understanding that single leading underscores are to be
used with module fields that are not meant to be imported.
Double leading underscores are to be used for psuedo-private
attributes because they trigger class-based name mangling,
such that __foo in class Bar is automatically translated to
_Bar__foo, which in turn helps to prevent namespace collisions.
To the best of my knowledge single-leading underscores do not
trigger a similar behavior when used in class definitions.
It seems that the single-underscore convention is used deliberately
in many cases for 'protected' attributes, but it seems in other
places that it is just used for what are arguably private attributes.
I would personally suggest that we move away from 'protected' or accidental
single-underscore attributes, refactoring 'protected' use where necessary.

Inefficiency of Reference cycles in SchemaElement and potential memory leaks:
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Since Python is primarily a reference counting language, with a limited cycle detecting
garbage collector, I think it would make sense to change the parent attribute of SchemaElement
to be a weakref or to consider refactoring SchemeElement to remove it entirely. To the best of my knowledge,
the parent attribute is read in only one method, SchemaElement.setIsSet, and in this situation,
it does not appear to be necessary if the parent was otherwise unreachable. Also, if a subclass of
SchemeElement were to override __del__, it would result in a memory leak since, to the
best of my knowledge, the garbage collector does not collect objects which override __del__.
Since Schemas seem to be one of the most prolific data-structures in the Stamped implementation,
I am fairly certain that moving them over to pure reference counting would result in an appreciable
performance gain.
